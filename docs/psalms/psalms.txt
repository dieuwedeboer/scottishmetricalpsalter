Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1That man hath perfect blessedness,
who walketh not astray
In counsel of ungodly men,
nor stands in sinners' way,
Nor sitteth in the scorner's chair:
2But placeth his delight
Upon God's law, and meditates
on his law day and night.
3He shall be like a tree that grows
near planted by a river,
Which in his season yields his fruit,
and his leaf fadeth never:
And all he doth shall prosper well
4The wicked are not so;
But like they are unto the chaff,
which wind drives to and fro.
5In judgment therefore shall not stand
such as ungodly are;
Nor in th' assembly of the just
shall wicked men appear.
6For why? the way of godly men
unto the Lord is known:
Whereas the way of wicked men
shall quite be overthrown.

1Why rage the heathen?
and vain things why do the people mind?
2Kings of the earth do set themselves,
and princes are combin'd,
To plot against the Lord, and his
Anointed, saying thus,
3Let us asunder break their bands,
and cast their cords from us.
4He that in heaven sits shall laugh;
the Lord shall scorn them all.
5Then shall he speak to them in wrath,
in rage he vex them shall.
6Yet, notwithstanding,
I have him to be my King appointed;
And over Sion, my holy hill,
I have him King anointed.
7The sure decree I will declare:
The Lord hath said to me,
Thou art mine only Son;
this day I have begotten thee.
8Ask of me, and for heritage
the heathen I'll make thine;
And, for possession, I to thee
will give earth's utmost line.
9Thou shalt, as with a weighty rod
of iron, break them all;
And, as a potter's sherd, thou shalt
them dash in pieces small.
10Now therefore, kings, be wise;
be taught, ye judges of the earth:
11Serve God in fear, and see that
ye join trembling with your mirth.
12Kiss ye the Son, lest in his ire
ye perish from the way,
If once his wrath begin to burn:
bless'd all that on him stay.

A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.
1O Lord, how are my foes increas'd?
against me many rise.
2Many say of my soul, For him
in God no succour lies.
3Yet thou my shield and glory art,
th' uplifter of mine head.
4I cry'd, and, from his holy hill,
the Lord me answer made.
5I laid me down and slept; I wak'd;
for God sustained me.
6I will not fear though thousands ten
set round against me be.
7Arise, O Lord; save me, my God;
for thou my foes hast stroke
All on the cheek-bone, and the teeth
of wicked men hast broke.
8Salvation doth appertain
unto the Lord alone:
Thy blessing, Lord, for evermore
thy people is upon.

To the chief Musician on Neginoth,
A Psalm of David.
1Give ear unto me when I call,
God of my righteousness:
Have mercy, hear my pray'r; thou hast
enlarg'd me in distress.
2O ye the sons of men! how long
will ye love vanities?
How long my glory turn to shame,
and will ye follow lies?
3But know, that for himself the Lord
the godly man doth choose:
The Lord, when I on him do call,
to hear will not refuse.
4Fear, and sin not; talk with your heart on bed,
and silent be.
5Off 'rings present of righteousness,
and in the Lord trust ye.
6O who will shew us any good?
is that which many say:
But of thy countenance the light,
Lord, lift on us alway.
7Upon my heart, bestow'd by thee,
more gladness I have found
Than they, ev'n then, when corn and wine
did most with them abound.
8I will both lay me down in peace,
and quiet sleep will take;
Because thou only me to dwell
in safety, Lord, dost make.

To the chief Musician, upon Nehiloth,
A Psalm of David.
1Give ear unto my words, O Lord,
my meditation weigh.
2Hear my loud cry, my King, my God;
for I to thee will pray.
3Lord, thou shalt early hear my voice:
I early will direct
My pray'r to thee; and, looking up,
an answer will expect.
4For thou art not a God that doth
in wickedness delight;
Neither shall evil dwell with thee,
5Nor fools stand in thy sight.
All that ill-doers are thou hat'st;
6Cutt'st off that liars be:
The bloody and deceitful man
abhorred is by thee.
7But I into thy house will come
in thine abundant grace;
And I will worship in thy fear
toward thy holy place.
8Because of those mine enemies,
Lord, in thy righteousness
Do thou me lead; do thou thy way
make straight before my face.
9For in their mouth there is no truth,
their inward part is ill;
Their throat's an open sepulchre,
their tongue doth flatter still.
10O God, destroy them; let them be
by their own counsel quell'd:
Them for their many sins cast out,
for they 'gainst thee rebell'd.
11But let all joy that trust in thee,
and still make shouting noise;
For them thou sav'st; let all that love
thy name in thee rejoice.
12For, Lord, unto the righteous man
thou wilt thy blessing yield:
With favour thou wilt compass him
about, as with a shield.

To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith,
A Psalm of David.
1Lord, in thy wrath rebuke me not;
Nor in thy hot rage chasten me.
2Lord, pity me, for I am weak:
Heal me, for my bones vexed be.
3My soul is also vexed sore;
But, Lord, how long stay wilt thou make?
4Return, O Lord, my soul set free;
O save me, for thy mercies' sake.
5Because those that deceased are
Of thee shall no remembrance have;
And who is he that will to thee
Give praises lying in the grave?
6I with my groaning weary am,
I also all the night my bed
Have caused for to swim; and I
With tears my couch have watered.
7Mine eye, consum'd with grief, grows old,
Because of all mine enemies.
8Hence from me, wicked workers all;
For God hath heard my weeping cries.
9God hath my supplication heard,
My pray'r received graciously
10Sham'd and sore vex'd be all my foes,
Sham'd and back turned suddenly.

Second Version
Meter: 8,6,8,6
1In thy great indignation,
O Lord, rebuke me not;
Nor on me lay thy chast 'ning hand,
in thy displeasure hot.
2Lord, I am weak, therefore on me
have mercy, and me spare:
Heal me, O Lord, because thou know'st
my bones much vexed are.
3My soul is vexed sore:
but, Lord, how long stay wilt thou make?
4Return, Lord, free my soul; and save
me, for thy mercies' sake.
5Because of thee in death there shall
no more remembrance be:
Of those that in the grave do lie,
who shall give thanks to thee?
6I with my groaning weary am,
and all the night my bed
I caused for to swim;
with tears my couch I watered.
7By reason of my vexing grief,
mine eye consumed is;
It waxeth old, because of all
that be mine enemies.
8But now, depart from me all ye
that work iniquity:
For why? the Lord hath heard my voice,
when I did mourn and cry.
9Unto my supplication
the Lord did hearing give:
When I to him my prayer make,
the Lord will it receive.
10Let all be sham'd and troubled sore,
That en'mies are to me;
Let them turn back, and suddenly
ashamed let them be.

Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the Lord,
concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite.
1O Lord my God, in thee do I
my confidence repose:
Save and deliver me from all
my persecuting foes;
2Lest that the enemy my soul
should, like a lion, tear,
In pieces rending it, while there
is no deliverer.
3O Lord my God, if it be so
that I committed this;
If it be so that in my hands
iniquity there is:
4If I rewarded ill to him
that was at peace with me;
(Yea, ev'n the man that without cause
my foe was I did free;)
5Then let the foe pursue and take
my soul, and my life thrust
Down to the earth,
and let him lay mine honour in the dust.
6Rise in thy wrath, Lord, raise thyself,
for my foes raging be;
And, to the judgment which thou hast
commanded, wake for me.
7So shall th' assembly of thy folk
about encompass thee:
Thou, therefore, for their sakes, return
unto thy place on high.
8The Lord he shall the people judge:
my judge, JEHOVAH, be,
After my righteousness, and mine
integrity in me.
9O let the wicked's malice end;
but stablish stedfastly
The righteous: for the righteous God
the hearts and reins doth try.
10In God, who saves th' upright in heart,
is my defence and stay.
11God just men judgeth, God is wroth
with ill men ev'ry day.
12If he do not return again,
then he his sword will whet;
His bow he hath already bent,
and hath it ready set:
13He also hath for him prepar'd
the instruments of death;
Against the persecutors he
his shafts ordained hath.
14Behold, he with iniquity
doth travail, as in birth;
A mischief he conceived hath,
and falsehood shall bring forth.
15He made a pit and digg'd it deep,
another there to take;
But he is fall'n into the ditch
which he himself did make.
16Upon his own head his mischief
shall be returned home;
His vi'lent dealing also down
on his own pate shall come.
17According to his righteousness
the Lord I'll magnify;
And will sing praise unto the name
of God that is most high.

To the chief Musician upon Gittith,
A Psalm of David.
1How excellent in all the earth,
Lord, our Lord, is thy name!
Who hast thy glory far advanc'd
above the starry frame.
2From infants' and from sucklings' mouth
thou didest strength ordain,
For thy foes' cause, that so thou might'st
th' avenging foe restrain.
3When I look up unto the heav'ns,
which thine own fingers fram'd,
Unto the moon, and to the stars,
which were by thee ordain'd;
4Then say I, What is man, that he
remember'd is by thee?
Or what the son of man, that thou
so kind to him should'st be?
5For thou a little lower hast
him than the angels made;
With glory and with dignity
thou crowned hast his head.
6Of thy hands' works thou mad'st him lord,
all under's feet didst lay;
7All sheep and oxen, yea, and beasts
that in the field do stray;
8Fowls of the air, fish of the sea,
all that pass through the same.
9How excellent in all the earth,
Lord, our Lord, is thy name!

PSALMS 9

To the chief Musician upon Muth-labben,
A Psalm of David.
1Lord, thee I'll praise with all my heart,
thy wonders all proclaim.
2In thee, most High, I'll greatly joy,
and sing unto thy name.
3When back my foes were turn'd, they fell,
and perish'd at thy sight:
4For thou maintain'dst my right and cause;
on throne sat'st judging right.
5The heathen thou rebuked hast,
the wicked overthrown;
Thou hast put out their names, that they
may never more be known.
6O en'my! now destructions have
an end perpetual:
Thou cities raz'd; perish'd with them
is their memorial.
7God shall endure for aye; he doth
for judgment set his throne;
8In righteousness to judge the world,
justice to give each one.
9God also will a refuge be
for those that are oppress'd;
A refuge will he be in times
of trouble to distress'd.
10And they that know thy name, in thee
their confidence will place:
For thou hast not forsaken them
that truly seek thy face.
11O sing ye praises to the Lord,
that dwells in Sion hill;
And all the nations among
his deeds record ye still.
12When he enquireth after blood,
he then rememb'reth them:
The humble folk he not forgets
that call upon his name.
13Lord, pity me; behold the grief
which I from foes sustain;
Ev'n thou, who from the gates of death
dost raise me up again;
14That I, in Sion's daughters' gates,
may all thy praise advance;
And that I may rejoice always
in thy deliverance.
15The heathen are sunk in the pit
which they themselves prepar'd;
And in the net which they have hid
their own feet fast are snar'd.
16The Lord is by the judgment known
which he himself hath wrought:
The sinners' hands do make the snares
wherewith themselves are caught.
17They who are wicked into hell
each one shall turned be;
And all the nations that forget
to seek the Lord most high.
18For they that needy are shall not
forgotten be alway;
The expectation of the poor
shall not be lost for aye.
19Arise, Lord, let not man prevail;
judge heathen in thy sight:
20That they may know themselves but men,
the nations, Lord, affright.

PSALMS 10
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Wherefore is it that thou, O Lord,
dost stand from us afar?
And wherefore hidest thou thyself,
when times so troublous are?
2The wicked in his loftiness
doth persecute the poor:
In these devices they have fram'd
let them be taken sure.
3The wicked of his heart's desire
doth talk with boasting great;
He blesseth him that's covetous,
whom yet the Lord doth hate.
4The wicked, through his pride of face,
on God he doth not call;
And in the counsels of his heart
the Lord is not at all.
5His ways they always grievous are;
thy judgments from his sight
Removed are: at all his foes
he puffeth with despight.
6Within his heart he thus hath said,
I shall not moved be;
And no adversity at all
shall ever come to me.
7His mouth with cursing, fraud, deceit,
is fill'd abundantly;
And underneath his tongue there is
mischief and vanity.
8He closely sits in villages;
he slays the innocent:
Against the poor that pass him by
his cruel eyes are bent.
9He, lion-like, lurks in his den;
he waits the poor to take;
And when he draws him in his net,
his prey he doth him make.
10Himself he humbleth very low,
he croucheth down withal,
That so a multitude of poor
may by his strong ones fall.
11He thus hath said within his heart,
The Lord hath quite forgot;
He hides his countenance, and he
for ever sees it not.
12O Lord, do thou arise; O God,
lift up thine hand on high:
Put not the meek afflicted ones
out of thy memory.
13Why is it that the wicked man
thus doth the Lord despise?
Because that God will it require
he in his heart denies.
14Thou hast it seen; for their mischief
and spite thou wilt repay:
The poor commits himself to thee;
thou art the orphan's stay.
15The arm break of the wicked man,
and of the evil one;
Do thou seek out his wickedness,
until thou findest none.
16The Lord is King through ages all,
ev'n to eternity;
The heathen people from his land
are perish'd utterly.
17O Lord, of those that humble are
thou the desire didst hear;
Thou wilt prepare their heart, and thou
to hear wilt bend thine ear;
18To judge the fatherless, and those
that are oppressed sore;
That man, that is but sprung of earth,
may them oppress no more.

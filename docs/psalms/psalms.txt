Psalms 1â€”41
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1That man hath perfect blessedness,
who walketh not astray
In counsel of ungodly men,
nor stands in sinners' way,
Nor sitteth in the scorner's chair:
2But placeth his delight
Upon God's law, and meditates
on his law day and night.
3He shall be like a tree that grows
near planted by a river,
Which in his season yields his fruit,
and his leaf fadeth never:
And all he doth shall prosper well
4The wicked are not so;
But like they are unto the chaff,
which wind drives to and fro.
5In judgment therefore shall not stand
such as ungodly are;
Nor in th' assembly of the just
shall wicked men appear.
6For why? the way of godly men
unto the Lord is known:
Whereas the way of wicked men
shall quite be overthrown.

PSALM 2
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Why rage the heathen?
and vain things why do the people mind?
2Kings of the earth do set themselves,
and princes are combin'd,
To plot against the Lord, and his
Anointed, saying thus,
3Let us asunder break their bands,
and cast their cords from us.
4He that in heaven sits shall laugh;
the Lord shall scorn them all.
5Then shall he speak to them in wrath,
in rage he vex them shall.
6Yet, notwithstanding,
I have him to be my King appointed;
And over Sion, my holy hill,
I have him King anointed.
7The sure decree I will declare:
The Lord hath said to me,
Thou art mine only Son;
this day I have begotten thee.
8Ask of me, and for heritage
the heathen I'll make thine;
And, for possession, I to thee
will give earth's utmost line.
9Thou shalt, as with a weighty rod
of iron, break them all;
And, as a potter's sherd, thou shalt
them dash in pieces small.
10Now therefore, kings, be wise;
be taught, ye judges of the earth:
11Serve God in fear, and see that
ye join trembling with your mirth.
12Kiss ye the Son, lest in his ire
ye perish from the way,
If once his wrath begin to burn:
bless'd all that on him stay.

PSALM 3
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.
1O Lord, how are my foes increas'd?
against me many rise.
2Many say of my soul, For him
in God no succour lies.
3Yet thou my shield and glory art,
th' uplifter of mine head.
4I cry'd, and, from his holy hill,
the Lord me answer made.
5I laid me down and slept; I wak'd;
for God sustained me.
6I will not fear though thousands ten
set round against me be.
7Arise, O Lord; save me, my God;
for thou my foes hast stroke
All on the cheek-bone, and the teeth
of wicked men hast broke.
8Salvation doth appertain
unto the Lord alone:
Thy blessing, Lord, for evermore
thy people is upon.

PSALM 4
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician on Neginoth,
A Psalm of David.
1Give ear unto me when I call,
God of my righteousness:
Have mercy, hear my pray'r; thou hast
enlarg'd me in distress.
2O ye the sons of men! how long
will ye love vanities?
How long my glory turn to shame,
and will ye follow lies?
3But know, that for himself the Lord
the godly man doth choose:
The Lord, when I on him do call,
to hear will not refuse.
4Fear, and sin not; talk with your heart on bed,
and silent be.
5Off 'rings present of righteousness,
and in the Lord trust ye.
6O who will shew us any good?
is that which many say:
But of thy countenance the light,
Lord, lift on us alway.
7Upon my heart, bestow'd by thee,
more gladness I have found
Than they, ev'n then, when corn and wine
did most with them abound.
8I will both lay me down in peace,
and quiet sleep will take;
Because thou only me to dwell
in safety, Lord, dost make.

PSALM 5
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician, upon Nehiloth,
A Psalm of David.
1Give ear unto my words, O Lord,
my meditation weigh.
2Hear my loud cry, my King, my God;
for I to thee will pray.
3Lord, thou shalt early hear my voice:
I early will direct
My pray'r to thee; and, looking up,
an answer will expect.
4For thou art not a God that doth
in wickedness delight;
Neither shall evil dwell with thee,
5Nor fools stand in thy sight.
All that ill-doers are thou hat'st;
6Cutt'st off that liars be:
The bloody and deceitful man
abhorred is by thee.
7But I into thy house will come
in thine abundant grace;
And I will worship in thy fear
toward thy holy place.
8Because of those mine enemies,
Lord, in thy righteousness
Do thou me lead; do thou thy way
make straight before my face.
9For in their mouth there is no truth,
their inward part is ill;
Their throat's an open sepulchre,
their tongue doth flatter still.
10O God, destroy them; let them be
by their own counsel quell'd:
Them for their many sins cast out,
for they 'gainst thee rebell'd.
11But let all joy that trust in thee,
and still make shouting noise;
For them thou sav'st; let all that love
thy name in thee rejoice.
12For, Lord, unto the righteous man
thou wilt thy blessing yield:
With favour thou wilt compass him
about, as with a shield.

PSALM 6
First Version
Meter: 8,8,8,8
To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith,
A Psalm of David.
1Lord, in thy wrath rebuke me not;
Nor in thy hot rage chasten me.
2Lord, pity me, for I am weak:
Heal me, for my bones vexed be.
3My soul is also vexed sore;
But, Lord, how long stay wilt thou make?
4Return, O Lord, my soul set free;
O save me, for thy mercies' sake.
5Because those that deceased are
Of thee shall no remembrance have;
And who is he that will to thee
Give praises lying in the grave?
6I with my groaning weary am,
I also all the night my bed
Have caused for to swim; and I
With tears my couch have watered.
7Mine eye, consum'd with grief, grows old,
Because of all mine enemies.
8Hence from me, wicked workers all;
For God hath heard my weeping cries.
9God hath my supplication heard,
My pray'r received graciously
10Sham'd and sore vex'd be all my foes,
Sham'd and back turned suddenly.

PSALM 6b
Second Version
Meter: 8,6,8,6
1In thy great indignation,
O Lord, rebuke me not;
Nor on me lay thy chast 'ning hand,
in thy displeasure hot.
2Lord, I am weak, therefore on me
have mercy, and me spare:
Heal me, O Lord, because thou know'st
my bones much vexed are.
3My soul is vexed sore:
but, Lord, how long stay wilt thou make?
4Return, Lord, free my soul; and save
me, for thy mercies' sake.
5Because of thee in death there shall
no more remembrance be:
Of those that in the grave do lie,
who shall give thanks to thee?
6I with my groaning weary am,
and all the night my bed
I caused for to swim;
with tears my couch I watered.
7By reason of my vexing grief,
mine eye consumed is;
It waxeth old, because of all
that be mine enemies.
8But now, depart from me all ye
that work iniquity:
For why? the Lord hath heard my voice,
when I did mourn and cry.
9Unto my supplication
the Lord did hearing give:
When I to him my prayer make,
the Lord will it receive.
10Let all be sham'd and troubled sore,
That en'mies are to me;
Let them turn back, and suddenly
ashamed let them be.

PSALM 7
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the Lord,
concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite.
1O Lord my God, in thee do I
my confidence repose:
Save and deliver me from all
my persecuting foes;
2Lest that the enemy my soul
should, like a lion, tear,
In pieces rending it, while there
is no deliverer.
3O Lord my God, if it be so
that I committed this;
If it be so that in my hands
iniquity there is:
4If I rewarded ill to him
that was at peace with me;
(Yea, ev'n the man that without cause
my foe was I did free;)
5Then let the foe pursue and take
my soul, and my life thrust
Down to the earth,
and let him lay mine honour in the dust.
6Rise in thy wrath, Lord, raise thyself,
for my foes raging be;
And, to the judgment which thou hast
commanded, wake for me.
7So shall th' assembly of thy folk
about encompass thee:
Thou, therefore, for their sakes, return
unto thy place on high.
8The Lord he shall the people judge:
my judge, JEHOVAH, be,
After my righteousness, and mine
integrity in me.
9O let the wicked's malice end;
but stablish stedfastly
The righteous: for the righteous God
the hearts and reins doth try.
10In God, who saves th' upright in heart,
is my defence and stay.
11God just men judgeth, God is wroth
with ill men ev'ry day.
12If he do not return again,
then he his sword will whet;
His bow he hath already bent,
and hath it ready set:
13He also hath for him prepar'd
the instruments of death;
Against the persecutors he
his shafts ordained hath.
14Behold, he with iniquity
doth travail, as in birth;
A mischief he conceived hath,
and falsehood shall bring forth.
15He made a pit and digg'd it deep,
another there to take;
But he is fall'n into the ditch
which he himself did make.
16Upon his own head his mischief
shall be returned home;
His vi'lent dealing also down
on his own pate shall come.
17According to his righteousness
the Lord I'll magnify;
And will sing praise unto the name
of God that is most high.

PSALM 8
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician upon Gittith,
A Psalm of David.
1How excellent in all the earth,
Lord, our Lord, is thy name!
Who hast thy glory far advanc'd
above the starry frame.
2From infants' and from sucklings' mouth
thou didest strength ordain,
For thy foes' cause, that so thou might'st
th' avenging foe restrain.
3When I look up unto the heav'ns,
which thine own fingers fram'd,
Unto the moon, and to the stars,
which were by thee ordain'd;
4Then say I, What is man, that he
remember'd is by thee?
Or what the son of man, that thou
so kind to him should'st be?
5For thou a little lower hast
him than the angels made;
With glory and with dignity
thou crowned hast his head.
6Of thy hands' works thou mad'st him lord,
all under's feet didst lay;
7All sheep and oxen, yea, and beasts
that in the field do stray;
8Fowls of the air, fish of the sea,
all that pass through the same.
9How excellent in all the earth,
Lord, our Lord, is thy name!

PSALM 9
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician upon Muth-labben,
A Psalm of David.
1Lord, thee I'll praise with all my heart,
thy wonders all proclaim.
2In thee, most High, I'll greatly joy,
and sing unto thy name.
3When back my foes were turn'd, they fell,
and perish'd at thy sight:
4For thou maintain'dst my right and cause;
on throne sat'st judging right.
5The heathen thou rebuked hast,
the wicked overthrown;
Thou hast put out their names, that they
may never more be known.
6O en'my! now destructions have
an end perpetual:
Thou cities raz'd; perish'd with them
is their memorial.
7God shall endure for aye; he doth
for judgment set his throne;
8In righteousness to judge the world,
justice to give each one.
9God also will a refuge be
for those that are oppress'd;
A refuge will he be in times
of trouble to distress'd.
10And they that know thy name, in thee
their confidence will place:
For thou hast not forsaken them
that truly seek thy face.
11O sing ye praises to the Lord,
that dwells in Sion hill;
And all the nations among
his deeds record ye still.
12When he enquireth after blood,
he then rememb'reth them:
The humble folk he not forgets
that call upon his name.
13Lord, pity me; behold the grief
which I from foes sustain;
Ev'n thou, who from the gates of death
dost raise me up again;
14That I, in Sion's daughters' gates,
may all thy praise advance;
And that I may rejoice always
in thy deliverance.
15The heathen are sunk in the pit
which they themselves prepar'd;
And in the net which they have hid
their own feet fast are snar'd.
16The Lord is by the judgment known
which he himself hath wrought:
The sinners' hands do make the snares
wherewith themselves are caught.
17They who are wicked into hell
each one shall turned be;
And all the nations that forget
to seek the Lord most high.
18For they that needy are shall not
forgotten be alway;
The expectation of the poor
shall not be lost for aye.
19Arise, Lord, let not man prevail;
judge heathen in thy sight:
20That they may know themselves but men,
the nations, Lord, affright.

PSALM 10
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Wherefore is it that thou, O Lord,
dost stand from us afar?
And wherefore hidest thou thyself,
when times so troublous are?
2The wicked in his loftiness
doth persecute the poor:
In these devices they have fram'd
let them be taken sure.
3The wicked of his heart's desire
doth talk with boasting great;
He blesseth him that's covetous,
whom yet the Lord doth hate.
4The wicked, through his pride of face,
on God he doth not call;
And in the counsels of his heart
the Lord is not at all.
5His ways they always grievous are;
thy judgments from his sight
Removed are: at all his foes
he puffeth with despight.
6Within his heart he thus hath said,
I shall not moved be;
And no adversity at all
shall ever come to me.
7His mouth with cursing, fraud, deceit,
is fill'd abundantly;
And underneath his tongue there is
mischief and vanity.
8He closely sits in villages;
he slays the innocent:
Against the poor that pass him by
his cruel eyes are bent.
9He, lion-like, lurks in his den;
he waits the poor to take;
And when he draws him in his net,
his prey he doth him make.
10Himself he humbleth very low,
he croucheth down withal,
That so a multitude of poor
may by his strong ones fall.
11He thus hath said within his heart,
The Lord hath quite forgot;
He hides his countenance, and he
for ever sees it not.
12O Lord, do thou arise; O God,
lift up thine hand on high:
Put not the meek afflicted ones
out of thy memory.
13Why is it that the wicked man
thus doth the Lord despise?
Because that God will it require
he in his heart denies.
14Thou hast it seen; for their mischief
and spite thou wilt repay:
The poor commits himself to thee;
thou art the orphan's stay.
15The arm break of the wicked man,
and of the evil one;
Do thou seek out his wickedness,
until thou findest none.
16The Lord is King through ages all,
ev'n to eternity;
The heathen people from his land
are perish'd utterly.
17O Lord, of those that humble are
thou the desire didst hear;
Thou wilt prepare their heart, and thou
to hear wilt bend thine ear;
18To judge the fatherless, and those
that are oppressed sore;
That man, that is but sprung of earth,
may them oppress no more.

PSALM 11
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician,
A Psalm of David.
1I in the Lord do put my trust:
how is it then that ye
Say to my soul, Flee, as a bird,
unto your mountain high?
2For, lo, the wicked bend their bow,
their shafts on string they fit,
That those who upright are in heart
they privily may hit.
3If the foundations be destroy'd,
what hath the righteous done?
4God in his holy temple is,
in heaven is his throne:
His eyes do see, his eye-lids try
5men's sons. The just he proves:
But his soul hates the wicked man,
and him that vi'lence loves.
6Snares, fire and brimstone, furious storms,
on sinners he shall rain:
This, as the portion of their cup,
doth unto them pertain.
7Because the Lord most righteous doth
in righteousness delight;
And with a pleasant countenance
beholdeth the upright.

PSALM 12
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician upon Sheminith,
A Psalm of David.
1Help, Lord, because the godly man
doth daily fade away;
And from among the sons of men
the faithful do decay.
2Unto his neighbour ev'ry one
doth utter vanity:
They with a double heart do speak,
and lips of flattery.
3God shall cut off all flatt'ring lips,
tongues that speak proudly thus,
4We'll with our tongue prevail, our lips
are ours: who's lord o'er us?
5For poor oppress'd,
and for the sighs of needy, rise will
I, Saith God, and him in safety set
from such as him defy.
6The words of God are words most pure;
they be like silver try'd
In earthen furnace, seven times
that hath been purify'd.
7Lord, thou shalt them preserve and keep
for ever from this race.
8On each side walk the wicked, when
vile men are high in place.

PSALM 13
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician,
A Psalm of David.
1How long wilt thou forget me, Lord?
shall it for ever be?
O how long shall it be that thou
wilt hide thy face from me?
2How long take counsel in my soul,
still sad in heart, shall I?
How long exalted over me
Shall be mine enemy?
3O Lord my God, consider well,
and answer to me make:
Mine eyes enlighten, lest the sleep
of death me overtake:
4Lest that mine enemy should say,
Against him I prevail'd;
And those that trouble me rejoice,
when I am mov'd and fail'd.
5But I have all my confidence
thy mercy set upon;
My heart within me shall rejoice
in thy salvation.
6I will unto the Lord my God
sing praises cheerfully,
Because he hath his bounty shown
to me abundantly.

PSALM 14
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician,
A Psalm of David.
1That there is not a God, the fool
doth in his heart conclude:
They are corrupt, their works are vile;
not one of them doth good.
2Upon men's sons the Lord from heav'n
did cast his eyes abroad,
To see if any understood,
and did seek after God.
3They altogether filthy are,
they all aside are gone;
And there is none that doeth good,
yea, sure there is not one.
4These workers of iniquity
do they not know at all,
That they my people eat as bread,
and on God do not call?
5There fear'd they much; for God is with
the whole race of the just.
6You shame the counsel of the poor,
because God is his trust.
7Let Isr'el's help from Sion come:
when back the Lord shall bring
His captives, Jacob shall rejoice,
and Israel shall sing.

PSALM 15
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
A Psalm of David.
1Within thy tabernacle, Lord,
who shall abide with thee?
And in thy high and holy hill
who shall a dweller be?
2The man that walketh uprightly,
and worketh righteousness,
And as he thinketh in his heart,
so doth he truth express.
3Who doth not slander with his tongue,
nor to his friend doth hurt;
Nor yet against his neighbour doth
take up an ill report.
4In whose eyes vile men are despis'd;
but those that God do fear
He honoureth; and changeth not,
though to his hurt he swear.
5His coin puts not to usury,
nor take reward will he
Against the guiltless. Who doth
thus shall never moved be.

PSALM 16
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
Michtam of David.
1Lord, keep me; for I trust in thee.
2To God thus was my speech,
Thou art my Lord; and unto thee
my goodness doth not reach:
3To saints on earth, to th' excellent,
where my delight's all plac'd.
4Their sorrows shall be multiply'd
to other gods that haste:
Of their drink-offerings of blood
I will no off 'ring make;
Yea, neither I their very names
up in my lips will take.
5God is of mine inheritance
and cup the portion;
The lot that fallen is to me
thou dost maintain alone.
6Unto me happily the lines
in pleasant places fell;
Yea, the inheritance I got
in beauty doth excel.
7I bless the Lord, because he doth
by counsel me conduct;
And in the seasons of the night
my reins do me instruct.
8Before me still the Lord I set:
sith it is so that he
Doth ever stand at my right hand,
I shall not moved be.
9Because of this my heart is glad,
and joy shall be exprest
Ev'n by my glory; and my flesh
in confidence shall rest.
10Because my soul in grave to dwell
shall not be left by thee;
Nor wilt thou give thine Holy One
corruption to see.
11Thou wilt me shew the path of life:
of joys there is full store
Before thy face; at thy right hand
are pleasures evermore.

PSALM 17
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
A Prayer of David.
1Lord, hear the right, attend my cry,
unto my pray'r give heed,
That doth not in hypocrisy
from feigned lips proceed.
2And from before thy presence forth
my sentence do thou send:
Toward these things that equal are
do thou thine eyes intend.
3Thou prov'dst mine heart, thou visit'dst me
by night, thou didst me try,
Yet nothing found'st; for that my mouth
shall not sin, purpos'd I.
4As for men's works, I, by the word
that from thy lips doth flow,
Did me preserve out of the paths
wherein destroyers go.
5Hold up my goings, Lord, me guide
in those thy paths divine,
So that my footsteps may not slide
out of those ways of thine.
6I called have on thee, O God,
because thou wilt me hear:
That thou may'st hearken to my speech,
to me incline thine ear.
7Thy wondrous loving-kindness show,
thou that, by thy right hand,
Sav'st them that trust in thee from those
that up against them stand.
8As th' apple of the eye me keep;
in thy wings shade me close
9From lewd oppressors, compassing
me round, as deadly foes.
10In their own fat they are inclos'd;
their mouth speaks loftily.
11Our steps they compass'd; and to ground
down bowing set their eye.
12He like unto a lion is
that's greedy of his prey,
Or lion young, which lurking doth
in secret places stay.
13Arise, and disappoint my foe,
and cast him down,
O Lord: My soul save from the wicked man,
the man which is thy sword.
14From men, which are thy hand, O Lord,
from worldly men me save,
Which only in this present life
their part and portion have.
Whose belly with thy treasure hid
thou fill'st: they children have
In plenty; of their goods the rest
they to their children leave.
15But as for me, I thine own face
in righteousness will see;
And with thy likeness, when I wake,
I satisfy'd shall be.

PSALM 18
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician,
A Psalm of David, the servant of the Lord, who spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said,
1Thee will I love, O Lord, my strength.
2My fortress is the Lord,
My rock, and he that doth to me
deliverance afford:
My God, my strength, whom I will trust,
a buckler unto me,
The horn of my salvation,
and my high tow'r, is he.
3Upon the Lord, who worthy is
of praises, will I cry;
And then shall I preserved be
safe from mine enemy.
4Floods of ill men affrighted me,
death's pangs about me went;
5Hell's sorrows me environed;
death's snares did me prevent.
6In my distress I call'd on God,
cry to my God did I;
He from his temple heard my voice,
to his ears came my cry.
7Th' earth, as affrighted, then did shake,
trembling upon it seiz'd:
The hills' foundations moved were,
because he was displeas'd.
8Up from his nostrils came a smoke,
and from his mouth there came
Devouring fire, and coals by it
were turned into flame.
9He also bowed down the heav'ns,
and thence he did descend;
And thickest clouds of darkness did
under his feet attend.
10And he upon a cherub rode,
and thereon he did fly;
Yea, on the swift wings of the wind
his flight was from on high.
11He darkness made his secret place:
about him, for his tent,
Dark waters were, and thickest clouds
of th' airy firmament.
12And at the brightness of that light,
which was before his eye,
His thick clouds pass'd away, hailstones
and coals of fire did fly.
13The Lord God also in the heav'ns
did thunder in his ire;
And there the Highest gave his voice,
hailstones and coals of fire.
14Yea, he his arrows sent abroad,
and them he scattered;
His lightnings also he shot out,
and them discomfited.
15The waters' channels then were seen,
the world's foundations vast
At thy rebuke discover'd were,
and at thy nostrils' blast.
16And from above the Lord sent down,
and took me from below;
From many waters he me drew,
which would me overflow.
17He me reliev'd from my strong foes,
and such as did me hate;
Because he saw that they for me
too strong were, and too great.
18They me prevented in the day
of my calamity;
But even then the Lord himself
a stay was unto me.
19He to a place where liberty
and room was hath me brought;
Because he took delight in me,
he my deliv'rance wrought.
20According to my righteousness
he did me recompense,
He me repaid according to
my hands' pure innocence.
21For I God's ways kept, from my God
did not turn wickedly.
22His judgments were before me, I
his laws put not from me.
23Sincere before him was my heart;
with him upright was I;
And watchfully I kept myself
from mine iniquity.
24After my righteousness the Lord
hath recompensed me,
After the cleanness of my hands
appearing in his eye.
25Thou gracious to the gracious art,
to upright men upright:
26Pure to the pure, froward thou kyth'st
unto the froward wight.
27For thou wilt the afflicted save
in grief that low do lie:
But wilt bring down the countenance
of them whose looks are high.
28The Lord will light my candle so,
that it shall shine full bright:
The Lord my God will also make
my darkness to be light.
29By thee through troops of men I break,
and them discomfit all;
And, by my God assisting me,
I overleap a wall.
30As for God, perfect is his way:
the Lord his word is try'd;
He is a buckler to all those
who do in him confide.
31Who but the Lord is God? but he
who is a rock and stay?
32'Tis God that girdeth me with strength,
and perfect makes my way.
33He made my feet swift as the hinds,
set me on my high places.
34Mine hands to war he taught, mine arms
brake bows of steel in pieces.
35The shield of thy salvation
thou didst on me bestow:
Thy right hand held me up, and great
thy kindness made me grow.
36And in my way my steps thou hast
enlarged under me,
That I go safely, and my feet
are kept from sliding free.
37Mine en'mies I pursued have,
and did them overtake;
Nor did I turn again till I
an end of them did make.
38I wounded them, they could not rise;
they at my feet did fall.
39Thou girdedst me with strength for war;
my foes thou brought'st down all:
40And thou hast giv'n to me the necks
of all mine enemies;
That I might them destroy and slay,
who did against me rise.
41They cried out, but there was none
that would or could them save;
Yea, they did cry unto the Lord,
but he no answer gave.
42Then did I beat them small as dust
before the wind that flies;
And I did cast them out like dirt
upon the street that lies.
43Thou mad'st me free from people's strife,
and heathen's head to be:
A people whom I have not known
shall service do to me.
44At hearing they shall me obey,
to me they shall submit.
45Strangers for fear shall fade away,
who in close places sit.
46God lives, bless'd be my Rock; the God
of my health praised be.
47God doth avenge me, and subdues
the people under me.
48He saves me from mine enemies;
yea, thou hast lifted me
Above my foes; and from the man
of vi'lence set me free.
49Therefore to thee will I give thanks
the heathen folk among;
And to thy name, O Lord, I will
sing praises in a song.
50He great deliv'rance gives his king:
he mercy doth extend
To David, his anointed one,
and his seed without end.

PSALM 19
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician,
A Psalm of David.
1The heav'ns God's glory do declare,
the skies his hand-works preach:
2Day utters speech to day, and night
to night doth knowledge teach.
3There is no speech nor tongue to which
their voice doth not extend:
4Their line is gone through all the earth,
their words to the world's end.
In them he set the sun a tent;
5Who, bridegroom-like, forth goes
From's chamber, as a strong man doth
to run his race rejoice.
6From heav'n's end is his going forth,
circling to th' end again;
And there is nothing from his heat
that hidden doth remain.
7God's law is perfect, and converts
the soul in sin that lies:
God's testimony is most sure,
and makes the simple wise.
8The statutes of the Lord are right,
and do rejoice the heart:
The Lord's command is pure, and doth
light to the eyes impart.
9Unspotted is the fear of God,
and doth endure for ever:
The judgments of the Lord are true
and righteous altogether.
10They more than gold, yea, much fine gold,
to be desired are:
Than honey, honey from the comb
that droppeth, sweeter far.
11Moreover, they thy servant warn
how he his life should frame:
A great reward provided is
for them that keep the same.
12Who can his errors understand?
O cleanse thou me within
13From secret faults. Thy servant keep
from all presumptuous sin:
And do not suffer them to have
dominion over me:
Then, righteous and innocent,
I from much sin shall be.
14The words which from my mouth proceed,
the thoughts sent from my heart,
Accept, O Lord, for thou my strength
and my Redeemer art.

PSALM 20
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1 JEHOVAH hear thee in the day
when trouble he doth send:
And let the name of Jacob's God
thee from all ill defend.
2O let him help send from above,
out of his sanctuary:
From Sion, his own holy hill,
let him give strength to thee.
3Let him remember all thy gifts,
accept thy sacrifice:
4Grant thee thine heart's wish, and fulfil
thy thoughts and counsel wise.
5In thy salvation we will joy;
in our God's name we will
Display our banners: and the Lord
thy prayers all fulfil.
6Now know I God his king doth save:
he from his holy heav'n
Will hear him, with the saving strength
by his own right hand giv'n.
7In chariots some put confidence,
some horses trust upon:
But we remember will the name
of our Lord God alone.
8We rise, and upright stand, when they
are bowed down, and fall.
9Deliver, Lord; and let the King
us hear, when we do call.

PSALM 21
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician,
A Psalm of David.
1The king in thy great strength, O Lord,
shall very joyful be:
In thy salvation rejoice
how veh'mently shall he!
2Thou hast bestowed upon him
all that his heart would have;
And thou from him didst not withhold
whate'er his lips did crave.
3For thou with blessings him prevent'st
of goodness manifold;
And thou hast set upon his head
a crown of purest gold.
4When he desired life of thee,
thou life to him didst give;
Ev'n such a length of days,
that he for evermore should live.
5In that salvation wrought by thee
his glory is made great;
Honour and comely majesty
thou hast upon him set.
6Because that thou for evermore
most blessed hast him made;
And thou hast with thy countenance
made him exceeding glad.
7Because the king upon the Lord
his confidence doth lay;
And through the grace of the most High
shall not be mov'd away.
8Thine hand shall all those men find out
that en'mies are to thee;
Ev'n thy right hand shall find out those
of thee that haters be.
9Like fiery ov'n thou shalt them make,
when kindled is thine ire;
God shall them swallow in his wrath,
devour them shall the fire.
10Their fruit from earth thou shalt destroy,
their seed men from among:
11For they beyond their might 'gainst thee
did plot mischief and wrong.
12Thou therefore shalt make them turn back,
when thou thy shafts shalt place
Upon thy strings, made ready all
to fly against their face.
13In thy great pow'r and strength, O Lord,
be thou exalted high;
So shall we sing with joyful hearts,
thy power praise shall we.

PSALM 22
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician upon Aijeleth Shahar,
A Psalm of David.
1My God, my God, why hast thou me
forsaken? why so far
Art thou from helping me, and from
my words that roaring are?
2All day, my God, to thee I cry,
yet am not heard by thee;
And in the season of the night
I cannot silent be.
3But thou art holy, thou that dost
inhabit Isr'el's praise.
4Our fathers hop'd in thee, they hop'd
and thou didst them release.
5When unto thee they sent their cry,
to them deliv'rance came:
Because they put their trust in thee,
they were not put to shame.
6But as for me, a worm I am,
and as no man am priz'd:
Reproach of men I am, and by
the people am despis'd.
7All that me see laugh me to scorn;
shoot out the lip do they;
They nod and shake their heads at me,
and, mocking, thus do say,
8This man did trust in God, that he
would free him by his might:
Let him deliver him, sith he
had in him such delight.
9But thou art he out of the womb
that didst me safely take;
When I was on my mother's breasts
thou me to hope didst make.
10And I was cast upon thy care,
ev'n from the womb till now;
And from my mother's belly, Lord,
my God and guide art thou.
11Be not far off, for grief is near,
and none to help is found.
12Bulls many compass me, strong bulls
of Bashan me surround.
13Their mouths they open'd wide on me,
upon me gape did they,
Like to a lion ravening
and roaring for his prey.
14Like water I'm pour'd out, my bones
all out of joint do part:
Amidst my bowels, as the wax,
so melted is my heart.
15My strength is like a potsherd dry'd;
my tongue it cleaveth fast
Unto my jaws; and to the dust
of death thou brought me hast.
16For dogs have compass'd me about:
the wicked, that did meet
In their assembly, me inclos'd;
they pierc'd my hands and feet.
17I all my bones may tell; they do
upon me look and stare.
18Upon my vesture lots they cast,
and clothes among them share.
19But be not far, O Lord, my strength;
haste to give help to me.
20From sword my soul, from pow'r of dogs
my darling set thou free.
21Out of the roaring lion's mouth
do thou me shield and save:
For from the horns of unicorns
an ear to me thou gave.
22I will shew forth thy name unto
those that my brethren are;
Amidst the congregation
thy praise I will declare.
23Praise ye the Lord, who do him fear;
him glorify all ye
The seed of Jacob: fear him all
that Isr'el's children be.
24For he despis'd not nor abhorr'd
th' afflicted's misery;
Nor from him hid his face, but heard
when he to him did cry.
25Within the congregation great
my praise shall be of thee;
My vows before them that him fear
shall be perform'd by me.
26The meek shall eat, and shall be fill'd;
they also praise shall give
Unto the Lord that do him seek:
your heart shall ever live.
27All ends of th' earth remember shall,
and turn the Lord unto;
All kindreds of the nations
to him shall homage do:
28Because the kingdom to the Lord
doth appertain as his;
Likewise among the nations
the Governor he is.
29Earth's fat ones eat, and worship shall:
all who to dust descend
Shall bow to him; none of them can
his soul from death defend.
30A seed shall service do to him;
unto the Lord it shall
Be for a generation
reckon'd in ages all.
31They shall come, and they shall declare
his truth and righteousness
Unto a people yet unborn,
and that he hath done this.

PSALM 23
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want.
2He makes me down to lie
In pastures green: he leadeth me
the quiet waters by.
3My soul he doth restore again;
and me to walk doth make
Within the paths of righteousness,
ev'n for his own name's sake.
4Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,
yet will I fear none ill:
For thou art with me; and thy rod
and staff me comfort still.
5My table thou hast furnished
in presence of my foes;
My head thou dost with oil anoint,
and my cup overflows.
6Goodness and mercy all my life
shall surely follow me:
And in God's house for evermore
my dwelling-place shall be.

PSALM 24
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1The earth belongs unto the Lord,
and all that it contains;
The world that is inhabited,
and all that there remains.
2For the foundations thereof
he on the seas did lay,
And he hath it established
upon the floods to stay.
3Who is the man that shall ascend
into the hill of God?
Or who within his holy place
shall have a firm abode?
4Whose hands are clean, whose heart is pure,
and unto vanity
Who hath not lifted up his soul,
nor sworn deceitfully.
5He from th' Eternal shall receive
the blessing him upon,
And righteousness, ev'n from the God
of his salvation.
6This is the generation
that after him enquire,
O Jacob, who do seek thy face
with their whole heart's desire.
7Ye gates, lift up your heads on high;
ye doors that last for aye,
Be lifted up, that so the King
of glory enter may.
8But who of glory is the King?
The mighty Lord is this;
Ev'n that same Lord, that great in might
and strong in battle is.
9Ye gates, lift up your heads; ye doors,
doors that do last for aye,
Be lifted up, that so the King
of glory enter may.
10But who is he that is the King
of glory? who is this?
The Lord of hosts, and none but he,
the King of glory is.

First Version

1To thee I lift my soul:
2O Lord, I trust in thee:
My God, let me not be asham'd,
nor foes triumph o'er me.
3Let none that wait on thee
be put to shame at all;
But those that without cause transgress,
let shame upon them fall.
4Shew me thy ways, O Lord;
thy paths, O teach thou me:
5And do thou lead me in thy truth,
therein my teacher be:
For thou art God that dost
to me salvation send,
And I upon thee all the day
expecting do attend.
6Thy tender mercies, Lord,
I pray thee to remember,
And loving-kindnesses; for they
have been of old for ever.
7My sins and faults of youth
do thou, O Lord, forget:
After thy mercy think on me,
and for thy goodness great.
8God good and upright is:
the way he'll sinners show.
9The meek in judgment he will guide,
and make his path to know.
10The whole paths of the Lord
are truth and mercy sure,
To those that do his cov'nant keep,
and testimonies pure.
11Now, for thine own name's sake,
O Lord, I thee entreat
To pardon mine iniquity;
for it is very great.
12What man is he that fears
the Lord, and doth him serve?
Him shall he teach the way that he
shall choose, and still observe.
13His soul shall dwell at ease;
and his posterity
Shall flourish still, and of the earth
inheritors shall be.
14With those that fear him is
the secret of the Lord;
The knowledge of his covenant
he will to them afford.
15Mine eyes upon the Lord
continually are set:
For he it is that shall bring forth
my feet out of the net.
16Turn unto me thy face,
and to me mercy show;
Because that I am desolate,
and am brought very low.
17My heart's griefs are increas'd:
me from distress relieve.
18See mine affliction and my pain,
and all my sins forgive.
19Consider thou my foes,
because they many are;
And it a cruel hatred is
which they against me bear.
20O do thou keep my soul,
do thou deliver me:
And let me never be asham'd,
because I trust in thee.
21Let uprightness and truth
keep me, who thee attend.
22Redemption, Lord, to Israel
from all his troubles send.

1To thee I lift my soul, O Lord:
2My God, I trust in thee:
Let me not be asham'd;
let not my foes triumph o'er me
3Yea, let thou none ashamed be
that do on thee attend:
Ashamed let them be, O Lord,
who without cause offend.
4Thy ways, Lord, shew; teach me thy paths:
5Lead me in truth, teach me:
For of my safety thou art God;
all day I wait on thee.
6Thy mercies, that most tender are,
do thou, O Lord, remember,
And loving-kindnesses; for they
have been of old for ever.
7Let not the errors of my youth,
nor sins, remember'd be:
In mercy, for thy goodness' sake,
O Lord, remember me.
8The Lord is good and gracious,
he upright is also:
He therefore sinners will instruct
in ways that they should go.
9The meek and lowly he will guide
in judgment just alway:
To meek and poor afflicted ones
he'll clearly teach his way.
10The whole paths of the Lord our God
are truth and mercy sure,
To such as keep his covenant,
and testimonies pure.
11Now, for thine own name's sake, O Lord,
I humbly thee entreat
To pardon mine iniquity;
for it is very great.
12What man fears God? him shall he teach
he way that he shall chuse.
13His soul shall dwell at ease; his seed
the earth, as heirs, shall use.
14The secret of the Lord is with
such as do fear his name;
And he his holy covenant
will manifest to them.
15Towards the Lord my waiting eyes
continually are set;
For he it is that shall bring forth
my feet out of the net.
16O turn thee unto me, O God,
have mercy me upon;
Because I solitary am,
and in affliction.
17Enlarg'd the griefs are of mine heart;
me from distress relieve.
18See mine affliction and my pain,
and all my sins forgive.
19Consider thou mine enemies,
because they many are;
And it a cruel hatred is
which they against me bear.
20O do thou keep my soul;
O God, do thou deliver me:
Let me not be asham'd;
for I do put my trust in thee.
21O let integrity and truth
keep me, who thee attend.
22Redemption, Lord, to Israel
from all his troubles send.

1Judge me, O Lord, for I have walk'd

I trusted also in the Lord;
slide therefore shall not I.
2Examine me, and do me prove;
try heart and reins, O God:
3For thy love is before mine eyes,
thy truth's paths I have trode.
4With persons vain I have not sat,
nor with dissemblers gone:
5Th' assembly of ill men I hate;
to sit with such I shun.
6Mine hands in innocence, O Lord,
I'll wash and purify;
So to thine holy altar go,
and compass it will I:
7That I, with voice of thanksgiving,
may publish and declare,
And tell of all thy mighty works,
that great and wondrous are.
8The habitation of thy house,
Lord, I have loved well;
Yea, in that place I do delight
where doth thine honour dwell.
9With sinners gather not my soul,
and such as blood would spill:
10Whose hands mischievous plots, right hand
corrupting bribes do fill.
11But as for me, I will walk on
in mine integrity:
Do thou redeem me, and, O Lord,
be merciful to me.
12My foot upon an even place
doth stand with stedfastness:
Within the congregations
th' Eternal I will bless.

PSALM 27
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
A Psalm of David.
1The Lord's my light and saving health,
who shall make me dismay'd?
My life's strength is the Lord, of whom
then shall I be afraid?
2When as mine enemies and foes,
most wicked persons all,
To eat my flesh against me rose,
they stumbled and did fall.
3Against me though an host encamp,
my heart yet fearless is:
Though war against me rise, I will
be confident in this.
4One thing I of the Lord desir'd,
and will seek to obtain,
That all days of my life I may
within God's house remain;
That I the beauty of the Lord
behold may and admire,
And that I in his holy place
may rev'rently enquire.
5For he in his pavilion shall
me hide in evil days;
In secret of his tent me hide,
and on a rock me raise.
6And now, ev'n at this present time,
mine head shall lifted be
Above all those that are my foes,
and round encompass me:
Therefore unto his tabernacle
I'll sacrifices bring
Of joyfulness; I'll sing, yea, I
to God will praises sing.
7O Lord, give ear unto my voice,
when I do cry to thee;
Upon me also mercy have,
and do thou answer me.
8When thou didst say, Seek ye my face,
then unto thee reply
Thus did my heart, Above all things
thy face, Lord, seek will I.
9Far from me hide not thou thy face;
put not away from thee
Thy servant in thy wrath: thou hast
an helper been to me.
O God of my salvation,
leave me not, nor forsake:
10Though me my parents both should leave,
the Lord will me up take.
11O Lord, instruct me in thy way,
to me a leader be
In a plain path, because of those
that hatred bear to me.
12Give me not to mine en'mies' will;
for witnesses that lie
Against me risen are, and such
as breathe out cruelty.
13I fainted had, unless that I
believed had to see
The Lord's own goodness in the land
of them that living be.
14Wait on the Lord, and be thou strong,
and he shall strength afford
Unto thine heart; yea, do thou wait,
I say, upon the Lord.

when unto thee I cry;
When to thine holy oracle
I lift mine hands on high.
3With ill men draw me not away
that work iniquity;
That speak peace to their friends, while in
their hearts doth mischief lie.
4Give them according to their deeds
and ills endeavoured:
And as their handy-works deserve,
to them be rendered.
5God shall not build, but them destroy,
who would not understand
The Lord's own works, nor did regard

6For ever blessed be the Lord,
for graciously he heard
The voice of my petitions,
and prayers did regard.
7The Lord's my strength and shield; my heart
upon him did rely;
And I am helped: hence my heart

And with my song I will him praise.
8Their strength is God alone:

2Unto the Lord the glory give
that to his name is due;
And in the beauty of holiness
unto JEHOVAH bow.
3The Lord's voice on the waters is;
the God of majesty
Doth thunder, and on multitudes
of waters sitteth he.
4A pow'rful voice it is that comes
out from the Lord most high;
The voice of that great Lord is full
of glorious majesty.
5The voice of the Eternal doth
asunder cedars tear;
Yea, God the Lord doth cedars break
that Lebanon doth bear.
6He makes them like a calf to skip,

And, like to a young unicorn,
the mountain Sirion.
7God's voice divides the flames of fire;
8The desert it doth shake:
The Lord doth make the wilderness
of Kadesh all to quake.
9God's voice doth make the hinds to calve,
it makes the forest bare:
And in his temple ev'ry one
his glory doth declare.
10The Lord sits on the floods; the Lord
sits King, and ever shall.
11The Lord will give his people strength,
and with peace bless them all.

1Lord, I will thee extol, for thou
hast lifted me on high,
And over me thou to rejoice
mad'st not mine enemy.
2O thou who art the Lord my God,
I in distress to thee,
With loud cries lifted up my voice,
and thou hast healed me.
3O Lord, my soul thou hast brought up,
and rescu'd from the grave;
That I to pit should not go down,
alive thou didst me save.
4O ye that are his holy ones,
sing praise unto the Lord;
And give unto him thanks, when ye
his holiness record.
5For but a moment lasts his wrath;
life in his favour lies:
Weeping may for a night endure,
at morn doth joy arise.
6In my prosperity I said,
that nothing shall me move.
7O Lord, thou hast my mountain made
to stand strong by thy love:
But when that thou, O gracious God,
didst hide thy face from me,
Then quickly was my prosp'rous state
turn'd into misery.
8Wherefore unto the Lord my cry
I caused to ascend:
My humble supplication
I to the Lord did send.
9What profit is there in my blood,
when I go down to pit?
Shall unto thee the dust give praise?
thy truth declare shall it?
10Hear, Lord, have mercy; help me, Lord:
11Thou turned hast my sadness
To dancing; yea, my sackcloth loos'd,
and girded me with gladness;
12That sing thy praise my glory may,
and never silent be.
O Lord my God, for evermore
I will give thanks to thee.

PSALM 31
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician,
A Psalm of David.
1In thee, O Lord, I put my trust,
sham'd let me never be;
According to thy righteousness
do thou deliver me.
2Bow down thine ear to me, with speed
send me deliverance:
To save me, my strong rock be thou,
and my house of defence.
3Because thou art my rock, and thee
I for my fortress take;
Therefore do thou me lead and guide,
ev'n for thine own name's sake.
4And sith thou art my strength, therefore
pull me out of the net,
Which they in subtilty for me
so privily have set.
5Into thine hands I do commit
my sp'rit: for thou art he,
O thou, JEHOVAH, God of truth,
that hast redeemed me.
6Those that do lying vanities
regard, I have abhorr'd:
But as for me, my confidence
is fixed on the Lord.
7I'll in thy mercy gladly joy:
for thou my miseries
Consider'd hast; thou hast my soul
known in adversities:
8And thou hast not inclosed me
within the en'my's hand;
And by thee have my feet been made
in a large room to stand.
9O Lord, upon me mercy have,
for trouble is on me:
Mine eye, my belly, and my soul,
with grief consumed be.
10Because my life with grief is spent,
my years with sighs and groans:
My strength doth fail; and for my sin
consumed are my bones.
11I was a scorn to all my foes,
and to my friends a fear;
And specially reproach'd of those
that were my neighbours near:
When they me saw they from me fled.
12Ev'n so I am forgot,
As men are out of mind when dead:
I'm like a broken pot.
13For slanders I of many heard;
fear compass'd me, while they
Against me did consult, and plot
to take my life away.
14But as for me, O Lord, my trust
upon thee I did lay;
And I to thee, Thou art my God,
did confidently say.
15My times are wholly in thine hand:
do thou deliver me
From their hands that mine enemies
and persecutors be.
16Thy countenance to shine do thou
upon thy servant make:
Unto me give salvation,
for thy great mercies' sake.
17Let me not be asham'd, O Lord,
for on thee call'd I have:
Let wicked men be sham'd, let them
be silent in the grave.
18To silence put the lying lips,
that grievous things do say,
And hard reports, in pride and scorn,
on righteous men do lay.
19How great's the goodness thou for them
that fear thee keep'st in store,
And wrought'st for them that trust in thee
the sons of men before!
20In secret of thy presence thou
shalt hide them from man's pride:
From strife of tongues thou closely shalt,
as in a tent, them hide.
21All praise and thanks be to the Lord;
for he hath magnify'd
His wondrous love to me within
a city fortify'd.
22For from thine eyes cut off I am,
I in my haste had said;
My voice yet heard'st thou, when to thee
with cries my moan I made.
23O love the Lord, all ye his saints;
because the Lord doth guard
The faithful, and he plenteously
proud doers doth reward.
24Be of good courage, and he strength
unto your heart shall send,
All ye whose hope and confidence
doth on the Lord depend.

PSALM 32
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
A Psalm of David, Maschil.
1O blessed is the man to whom
is freely pardoned
All the transgression he hath done,
whose sin is covered.
2Bless'd is the man to whom the Lord
imputeth not his sin,
And in whose sp'rit there is no guile,
nor fraud is found therein.
3When as I did refrain my speech,
and silent was my tongue,
My bones then waxed old, because
I roared all day long.
4For upon me both day and night
thine hand did heavy lie,
So that my moisture turned is
in summer's drought thereby.
5I thereupon have unto thee
my sin acknowledged,
And likewise mine iniquity
I have not covered:
I will confess unto the Lord
my trespasses, said I;
And of my sin thou freely didst
forgive th' iniquity.
6For this shall ev'ry godly one
his prayer make to thee;
In such a time he shall thee seek,
as found thou mayest be.
Surely, when floods of waters great
do swell up to the brim,
They shall not overwhelm his soul,
nor once come near to him.
7Thou art my hiding-place, thou shalt
from trouble keep me free:
Thou with songs of deliverance
about shalt compass me.
8I will instruct thee, and thee teach
the way that thou shalt go;
And, with mine eye upon thee set,
I will direction show.
9Then be not like the horse or mule,
which do not understand;
Whose mouth, lest they come near to thee,
a bridle must command.
10Unto the man that wicked is
his sorrows shall abound;
But him that trusteth in the Lord
mercy shall compass round.
11Ye righteous, in the Lord be glad,
in him do ye rejoice:
All ye that upright are in heart,
for joy lift up your voice.

PSALM 33
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Ye righteous, in the Lord rejoice;
it comely is and right,
That upright men, with thankful voice,
should praise the Lord of might.
2Praise God with harp, and unto him
sing with the psaltery;
Upon a ten-string'd instrument
make ye sweet melody.
3A new song to him sing, and play
with loud noise skilfully;
4For right is God's word, all his works
are done in verity.
5To judgment and to righteousness
a love he beareth still;
The loving-kindness of the Lord
the earth throughout doth fill.
6The heavens by the word of God
did their beginning take;
And by the breathing of his mouth
he all their hosts did make.
7The waters of the seas he brings
together as an heap;
And in storehouses, as it were,
he layeth up the deep.
8Let earth, and all that live therein,
with rev'rence fear the Lord;
Let all the world's inhabitants
dread him with one accord.
9For he did speak the word, and done
it was without delay;
Established it firmly stood,
whatever he did say.
10God doth the counsel bring to nought
which heathen folk do take;
And what the people do devise
of none effect doth make.
11O but the counsel of the Lord
doth stand for ever sure;
And of his heart the purposes
from age to age endure.
12That nation blessed is, whose God
JEHOVAH is, and those
A blessed people are, whom for
his heritage he chose.
13The Lord from heav'n sees and beholds
all sons of men full well:
14He views all from his dwelling-place
that in the earth do dwell.
15He forms their hearts alike, and all
their doings he observes.
16Great hosts save not a king, much strength
no mighty man preserves.
17An horse for preservation
is a deceitful thing;
And by the greatness of his strength
can no deliv'rance bring.
18Behold on those that do him fear
the Lord doth set his eye;
Ev'n those who on his mercy do
with confidence rely.
19From death to free their soul, in dearth
life unto them to yield.
20Our soul doth wait upon the Lord;
he is our help and shield.
21Sith in his holy name we trust,
our heart shall joyful be.
22Lord, let thy mercy be on us,
as we do hope in thee.

PSALM 34
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
A Psalm of David, when he changed his behavior before Abimelech; who drove him away, and he departed.
1God will I bless all times; his praise
my mouth shall still express.
2My soul shall boast in God: the meek
shall hear with joyfulness.
3Extol the Lord with me, let us
exalt his name together.
4I sought the Lord, he heard, and did
me from all fears deliver.
5They look'd to him, and lighten'd were:
not shamed were their faces.
6This poor man cry'd, God heard, and sav'd
him from all his distresses.
7The angel of the Lord encamps,
and round encompasseth
All those about that do him fear,
and them delivereth.
8O taste and see that God is good:
who trusts in him is bless'd.
9Fear God his saints: none that him fear
shall be with want oppress'd.
10The lions young may hungry be,
and they may lack their food:
But they that truly seek the Lord
shall not lack any good.
11O children, hither do ye come,
and unto me give ear;
I shall you teach to understand
how ye the Lord should fear.
12What man is he that life desires,
to see good would live long?
13Thy lips refrain from speaking guile,
and from ill words thy tongue.
14Depart from ill, do good, seek peace,
pursue it earnestly.
15God's eyes are on the just; his ears
are open to their cry.
16The face of God is set against
those that do wickedly,
That he may quite out from the earth
cut off their memory.
17The righteous cry unto the Lord,
he unto them gives ear;
And they out of their troubles all
by him deliver'd are.
18The Lord is ever nigh to them
that be of broken sp'rit;
To them he safety doth afford
that are in heart contrite.
19The troubles that afflict the just
in number many be;
But yet at length out of them all
the Lord doth set him free.
20He carefully his bones doth keep,
whatever can befall;
That not so much as one of them
can broken be at all.
21Ill shall the wicked slay; laid waste
shall be who hate the just.
22The Lord redeems his servants' souls;
none perish that him trust.

PSALM 35
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
A Psalm of David.
1Plead, Lord, with those that plead; and fight
with those that fight with me.
2Of shield and buckler take thou hold,
stand up mine help to be.
3Draw also out the spear, and do
against them stop the way
That me pursue: unto my soul,
I'm thy salvation, say.
4Let them confounded be and sham'd
that for my soul have sought:
Who plot my hurt turn'd back be they,
and to confusion brought.
5Let them be like unto the chaff
that flies before the wind;
And let the angel of the Lord
pursue them hard behind.
6With darkness cover thou their way,
and let it slipp'ry prove;
And let the angel of the Lord
pursue them from above.
7For without cause have they for me
their net hid in a pit,
They also have without a cause
for my soul digged it.
8Let ruin seize him unawares;
his net he hid withal
Himself let catch; and in the same
destruction let him fall.
9My soul in God shall joy; and glad
in his salvation be:
10And all my bones shall say, O Lord,
who is like unto thee,
Which dost the poor set free from him
that is for him too strong;
The poor and needy from the man
that spoils and does him wrong?
11False witnesses rose; to my charge
things I not knew they laid.
12They, to the spoiling of my soul,
me ill for good repaid.
13But as for me, when they were sick,
in sackcloth sad I mourn'd:
My humbled soul did fast, my pray'r
into my bosom turn'd.
14Myself I did behave as he
had been my friend or brother;
I heavily bow'd down, as one
that mourneth for his mother.
15But in my trouble they rejoic'd,
gath'ring themselves together;
Yea, abjects vile together did
themselves against me gather:
I knew it not; they did me tear,
and quiet would not be.
16With mocking hypocrites, at feasts
they gnash'd their teeth at me.
17How long, Lord, look'st thou on? from those
destructions they intend
Rescue my soul, from lions young
my darling do defend.
18I will give thanks to thee, O Lord,
within th' assembly great;
And where much people gather'd are
thy praises forth will set.
19Let not my wrongful enemies
proudly rejoice o'er me;
Nor who me hate without a cause,
let them wink with the eye.
20For peace they do not speak at all;
but crafty plots prepare
Against all those within the land
that meek and quiet are.
21With mouths set wide, they 'gainst me said,
Ha, ha! our eye doth see.
22Lord, thou hast seen, hold not thy peace;
Lord, be not far from me.
23Stir up thyself; wake, that thou may'st
judgment to me afford,
Ev'n to my cause, O thou that art
my only God and Lord.
24O Lord my God, do thou me judge
after thy righteousness;
And let them not their joy 'gainst me
triumphantly express:
25Nor let them say within their hearts,
Ah, we would have it thus;
Nor suffer them to say, that he
is swallow'd up by us.
26Sham'd and confounded be they all
that at my hurt are glad;
Let those against me that do boast
with shame and scorn be clad.
27Let them that love my righteous cause
be glad, shout, and not cease
To say, The Lord be magnify'd,
who loves his servant's peace.
28Thy righteousness shall also be
declared by my tongue;
The praises that belong to thee
speak shall it all day long.

PSALM 36
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician,
A Psalm of David, the servant of the Lord.
1The wicked man's transgression
within my heart thus says,
Undoubtedly the fear of God
is not before his eyes.
2Because himself he flattereth
in his own blinded eye,
Until the hatefulness be found
of his iniquity.
3Words from his mouth proceeding are,
fraud and iniquity:
He to be wise, and to do good,
hath left off utterly.
4He mischief, lying on his bed,
most cunningly doth plot:
He sets himself in ways not good,
ill he abhorreth not.
5Thy mercy, Lord, is in the heav'ns;
thy truth doth reach the clouds:
6Thy justice is like mountains great;
thy judgments deep as floods:
Lord, thou preservest man and beast.
7How precious is thy grace!
Therefore in shadow of thy wings
men's sons their trust shall place.
8They with the fatness of thy house
shall be well satisfy'd;
From rivers of thy pleasures thou
wilt drink to them provide.
9Because of life the fountain pure
remains alone with thee;
And in that purest light of thine
we clearly light shall see.
10Thy loving-kindness unto them
continue that thee know;
And still on men upright in heart
thy righteousness bestow.
11Let not the foot of cruel pride
come, and against me stand;
And let me not removed be,
Lord, by the wicked's hand.
12There fallen are they, and ruined,
that work iniquities:
Cast down they are, and never shall
be able to arise.

PSALM 37
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
A Psalm of David.
1For evil-doers fret thou not
thyself unquietly;
Nor do thou envy bear to those
that work iniquity.
2For, even like unto the grass,
soon be cut down shall they;
And, like the green and tender herb,
they wither shall away.
3Set thou thy trust upon the Lord,
and be thou doing good;
And so thou in the land shalt dwell,
and verily have food.
4Delight thyself in God; he'll give
thine heart's desire to thee.
5Thy way to God commit, him trust,
it bring to pass shall he.
6And, like unto the light, he shall
thy righteousness display;
And he thy judgment shall bring forth
like noon-tide of the day.
7Rest in the Lord, and patiently
wait for him: do not fref
For him who, prosp'ring in his way,
success in sin doth get.
8Do thou from anger cease, and wrath
see thou forsake also:
Fret not thyself in any wise,
that evil thou should'st do.
9For those that evil doers are
shall be cut off and fall:
But those that wait upon the Lord
the earth inherit shall.
10For yet a little while, and then
the wicked shall not be;
His place thou shalt consider well,
but it thou shalt not see.
11But by inheritance the earth
the meek ones shall possess:
They also shall delight themselves
in an abundant peace.
12The wicked plots against the just,
and at him whets his teeth:
13The Lord shall laugh at him, because
his day he coming seeth.
14The wicked have drawn out the sword,
and bent their bow, to slay
The poor and needy, and to kill
men of an upright way.
15But their own sword, which they have drawn,
shall enter their own heart:
Their bows which they have bent shall break,
and into pieces part.
16A little that a just man hath
is more and better far
Than is the wealth of many such
as lewd and wicked are.
17For sinners' arms shall broken be;
but God the just sustains.
18God knows the just man's days, and still
their heritage remains.
19They shall not be asham'd when they
the evil time do see;
And when the days of famine are,
they satisfy'd shall be.
20But wicked men, and foes of God,
as fat of lambs, decay;
They shall consume, yea, into smoke
they shall consume away.
21The wicked borrows, but the same
again he doth not pay;
Whereas the righteous mercy shews,
and gives his own away.
22For such as blessed be of him
the earth inherit shall;
And they that cursed are of him
shall be destroyed all.
23A good man's footsteps by the Lord
are ordered aright;
And in the way wherein he walks
he greatly doth delight.
24Although he fall, yet shall he not
be cast down utterly;
Because the Lord with his own hand
upholds him mightily.
25I have been young, and now am old,
yet have I never seen
The just man left, nor that his seed
for bread have beggars been.
26He's ever merciful, and lends:
his seed is bless'd therefore.
27Depart from evil, and do good,
and dwell for evermore.
28For God loves judgment, and his saints
leaves not in any case;
They are kept ever: but cut off
shall be the sinner's race.
29The just inherit shall the land,
and ever in it dwell:
30The just man's mouth doth wisdom speak;
his tongue doth judgment tell.
31In's heart the law is of his God,
his steps slide not away.
32The wicked man doth watch the just,
and seeketh him to slay.
33Yet him the Lord will not forsake,
nor leave him in his hands:
The righteous will he not condemn,
when he in judgment stands.
34Wait on the Lord, and keep his way,
and thee exalt shall he
Th' earth to inherit; when cut off
the wicked thou shalt see.
35I saw the wicked great in pow'r,
spread like a green bay-tree:
36He pass'd, yea, was not; him I sought,
but found he could not be.
37Mark thou the perfect, and behold
the man of uprightness;
Because that surely of this man
the latter end is peace.
38But those men that transgressors are
shall be destroy'd together;
The latter end of wicked men
shall be cut off for ever.
39But the salvation of the just
is from the Lord above;
He in the time of their distress
their stay and strength doth prove.
40The Lord shall help, and them deliver:
he shall them free and save
From wicked men; because in him
their confidence they have.

PSALM 38
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1In thy great indignation,
O Lord, rebuke me not;
Nor on me lay thy chast'ning hand,
in thy displeasure hot.
2For in me fast thine arrows stick,
thine hand doth press me sore:
3And in my flesh there is no health,
nor soundness any more.
This grief I have, because thy wrath
is forth against me gone;
And in my bones there is no rest,
for sin that I have done.
4Because gone up above mine head
my great transgressions be;
And, as a weighty burden, they
too heavy are for me.
5My wounds do stink, and are corrupt;
my folly makes it so.
6I troubled am, and much bow'd down;
all day I mourning go.
7For a disease that loathsome is
so fills my loins with pain,
That in my weak and weary flesh
no soundness doth remain.
8So feeble and infirm am I,
and broken am so sore,
That, through disquiet of my heart,
I have been made to roar.
9O Lord, all that I do desire
is still before thine eye;
And of my heart the secret groans
not hidden are from thee.
10My heart doth pant incessantly,
my strength doth quite decay;
As for mine eyes, their wonted light
is from me gone away.
11My lovers and my friends do stand
at distance from my sore;
And those do stand aloof that were
kinsmen and kind before.
12Yea, they that seek my life lay snares:
who seek to do me wrong
Speak things mischievous, and deceits
imagine all day long.
13But, as one deaf, that heareth not,
I suffer'd all to pass;
I as a dumb man did become,
whose mouth not open'd was:
14As one that hears not, in whose mouth
are no reproofs at all.
15For, Lord, I hope in thee; my God,
thou'lt hear me when I call.
16For I said, Hear me, lest they should
rejoice o'er me with pride;
And o'er me magnify themselves,
when as my foot doth slide.
17For I am near to halt, my grief
is still before mine eye:
18For I'll declare my sin, and grieve
for mine iniquity.
19But yet mine en'mies lively are,
and strong are they beside;
And they that hate me wrongfully
are greatly multiply'd.
20And they for good that render ill,
as en'mies me withstood;
Yea, ev'n for this, because that I
do follow what is good.
21Forsake me not, O Lord; my God,
far from me never be.
22O Lord, thou my salvation art,
haste to give help to me.

PSALM 39
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician, even to Jeduthan,
A Psalm of David.
1I said, I will look to my ways,
lest with my tongue I sin:
In sight of wicked men my mouth
with bridle I'll keep in.
2With silence I as dumb became,
I did myself restrain
From speaking good; but then the more
increased was my pain.
3My heart within me waxed hot;
and, while I musing was,
The fire did burn; and from my tongue
these words I did let pass:
4Mine end, and measure of my days,
O Lord, unto me show
What is the same; that I thereby
my frailty well may know.
5Lo, thou my days an handbreadth mad'st;
mine age is in thine eye
As nothing: sure each man at best
is wholly vanity.
6Sure each man walks in a vain show;
they vex themselves in vain:
He heaps up wealth, and doth not know
to whom it shall pertain.
7And now, O Lord, what wait I for?
my hope is fix'd on thee.
8Free me from all my trespasses,
the fool's scorn make not me.
9Dumb was I, op'ning not my mouth,
because this work was thine.
10Thy stroke take from me; by the blow
of thine hand I do pine.
11When with rebukes thou dost correct
man for iniquity,
Thou wastes his beauty like a moth:
sure each man's vanity.
12Attend my cry, Lord, at my tears
and pray'rs not silent be:
I sojourn as my fathers all,
and stranger am with thee.
13O spare thou me, that I my strength
recover may again,
Before from hence I do depart,
and here no more remain.

PSALM 40
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1I waited for the Lord my God,
and patiently did bear;
At length to me he did incline
my voice and cry to hear.
2He took me from a fearful pit,
and from the miry clay,
And on a rock he set my feet,
establishing my way.
3He put a new song in my mouth,
our God to magnify:
Many shall see it, and shall fear,
and on the Lord rely.
4O blessed is the man whose trust
upon the Lord relies;
Respecting not the proud, nor such
as turn aside to lies.
5O Lord my God, full many are
the wonders thou hast done;
Thy gracious thoughts to us-ward far
above all thoughts are gone:
In order none can reckon them
to thee: if them declare,
And speak of them I would, they more
than can be number'd are.
6No sacrifice nor offering
didst thou at all desire;
Mine ears thou bor'd: sin-off 'ring thou
and burnt didst not require:
7Then to the Lord these were my words,
I come, behold and see;
Within the volume of the book
it written is of me:
8To do thy will I take delight,
O thou my God that art;
Yea, that most holy law of thine
I have within my heart.
9Within the congregation great
I righteousness did preach:
Lo, thou dost know, O Lord, that I
refrained not my speech.
10I never did within my heart
conceal thy righteousness;
I thy salvation have declar'd,
and shown thy faithfulness:
Thy kindness, which most loving is,
concealed have not I,
Nor from the congregation great
have hid thy verity.
11Thy tender mercies, Lord, from me
O do thou not restrain;
Thy loving-kindness, and thy truth,
let them me still maintain.
12For ills past reck'ning compass me,
and mine iniquities
Such hold upon me taken have,
I cannot lift mine eyes:
They more than hairs are on mine head,
thence is my heart dismay'd.
13Be pleased, Lord, to rescue me;
Lord, hasten to mine aid.
14Sham'd and confounded be they all
that seek my soul to kill;
Yea, let them backward driven be,
and sham'd, that wish me ill.
15For a reward of this their shame
confounded let them be.
That in this manner scoffing say,
Aha, aha! to me.
16In thee let all be glad, and joy,
who seeking thee abide;
Who thy salvation love, say still,
The Lord be magnify'd.
17I'm poor and needy, yet the Lord
of me a care doth take:
Thou art my help and saviour,
my God, no tarrying make.

PSALM 41
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician,
A Psalm of David.
1Blessed is he that wisely doth
the poor man's case consider;
For when the time of trouble is,
the Lord will him deliver.
2God will him keep, yea, save alive;
on earth he bless'd shall live;
And to his enemies' desire
thou wilt him not up give.
3God will give strength when he on bed
of languishing doth mourn;
And in his sickness sore, O Lord,
thou all his bed wilt turn.
4I said, O Lord, do thou extend
thy mercy unto me;
O do thou heal my soul; for why?
I have offended thee.
5Those that to me are enemies,
of me do evil say,
When shall he die, that so his name
may perish quite away?
6To see me if he comes, he speaks
vain words: but then his heart
Heaps mischief to it, which he tells,
when forth he doth depart.
7My haters jointly whispering,
'gainst me my hurt devise.
8Mischief, say they, cleaves fast to him;
he li'th, and shall not rise.
9Yea, ev'n mine own familiar friend,
on whom I did rely,
Who ate my bread, ev'n he his heel
against me lifted high.
10But, Lord, be merciful to me,
and up again me raise,
That I may justly them requite
according to their ways.
11By this I know that certainly
I favour'd am by thee;
Because my hateful enemy
triumphs not over me.
12But as for me, thou me uphold'st
in mine integrity;
And me before thy countenance
thou sett'st continually.
13The Lord, the God of Israel,
be bless'd for ever then,
From age to age eternally.
Amen, yea, and amen.

Psalms 42â€”72
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician,
Maschil, for the sons of Korah.
1Like as the hart for water-brooks
in thirst doth pant and bray;
So pants my longing soul, O God,
that come to thee I may.
2My soul for God, the living God,
doth thirst: when shall I near
Unto thy countenance approach,
and in God's sight appear?
3My tears have unto me been meat,
both in the night and day,
While unto me continually,
Where is thy God? they say.
4My soul is poured out in me,
when this I think upon;
Because that with the multitude
I heretofore had gone:
With them into God's house I went,
with voice of joy and praise;
Yea, with the multitude that kept
the solemn holy days.
5O why art thou cast down, my soul?
why in me so dismay'd?
Trust God, for I shall praise him yet,
his count'nance is mine aid.
6My God, my soul's cast down in me;
thee therefore mind I will
From Jordan's land, the Hermonites,
and ev'n from Mizar hill.
7At the noise of thy water-spouts
deep unto deep doth call;
Thy breaking waves pass over me,
yea, and thy billows all.
8His loving-kindness yet the Lord
command will in the day,
His song's with me by night; to God,
by whom I live, I'll pray:
9And I will say to God my rock,
Why me forgett'st thou so?
Why, for my foes' oppression,
thus mourning do I go?
10'Tis as a sword within my bones,
when my foes me upbraid;
Ev'n when by them, Where is thy God?
'tis daily to me said.
11O why art thou cast down, my soul?
why, thus with grief opprest,
Art thou disquieted in me?
in God still hope and rest:
For yet I know I shall him praise,
who graciously to me
The health is of my countenance,
yea, mine own God is he.

PSALM 43
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Judge me, O God, and plead my cause
against th' ungodly nation;
From the unjust and crafty man,
O be thou my salvation.
2For thou the God art of my strength;
why thrusts thou me thee fro'?
For th' enemy's oppression
why do I mourning go?
3O send thy light forth and thy truth;
let them be guides to me,
And bring me to thine holy hill,
ev'n where thy dwellings be.
4Then will I to God's altar go,
to God my chiefest joy:
Yea, God, my God, thy name to praise
my harp I will employ.
5Why art thou then cast down, my soul?
what should discourage thee?
And why with vexing thoughts art thou
disquieted in me?
Still trust in God; for him to praise
good cause I yet shall have:
He of my count'nance is the health,
my God that doth me save.

PSALM 44
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician, for the sons of Korah, Maschil.
1O God, we with our ears have heard,
our fathers have us told,
What works thou in their days hadst done,
ev'n in the days of old.
2Thy hand did drive the heathen out,
and plant them in their place;
Thou didst afflict the nations,
but them thou didst increase.
3For neither got their sword the land,
nor did their arm them save;
But thy right hand, arm, countenance;
for thou them favour gave.
4Thou art my King: for Jacob, Lord,
deliv'rances command.
5Through thee we shall push down our foes,
that do against us stand:
We, through thy name, shall tread down those
that ris'n against us have.
6For in my bow I shall not trust,
nor shall my sword me save.
7But from our foes thou hast us sav'd,
our haters put to shame.
8In God we all the day do boast,
and ever praise thy name.
9But now we are cast off by thee,
and us thou putt'st to shame;
And when our armies do go forth,
thou go'st not with the same.
10Thou mak'st us from the enemy,
faint-hearted, to turn back;
And they who hate us for themselves
our spoils away do take.
11Like sheep for meat thou gavest us;
'mong heathen cast we be.
12Thou didst for nought thy people sell;
their price enrich'd not thee.
13Thou mak'st us a reproach to be
unto our neighbours near;
Derision and a scorn to them
that round about us are.
14A by-word also thou dost us
among the heathen make;
The people, in contempt and spite,
at us their heads do shake.
15Before me my confusion
continually abides;
And of my bashful countenance
the shame me ever hides:
16For voice of him that doth reproach,
and speaketh blasphemy;
By reason of th' avenging foe,
and cruel enemy.
17All this is come on us, yet we
have not forgotten thee;
Nor falsely in thy covenant
behav'd ourselves have we.
18Back from thy way our heart not turn'd;
our steps no straying made;
19Though us thou brak'st in dragons' place,
and cover'dst with death's shade.
20If we God's name forgot, or stretch'd
to a strange god our hands,
21Shall not God search this out? for he
heart's secrets understands.
22Yea, for thy sake we're kill'd all day,
counted as slaughter-sheep.
23Rise, Lord, cast us not ever off;
awake, why dost thou sleep?
24O wherefore hidest thou thy face?
forgett'st our cause distress'd,
25And our oppression? For our soul
is to the dust down press'd:
Our belly also on the earth
fast cleaving, hold doth take.
26Rise for our help, and us redeem,
ev'n for thy mercies' sake.

To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, for the sons of Korah, Maschil, A Song of loves.
1My heart brings forth a goodly thing;
my words that I indite
Concern the King: my tongue's a pen
of one that swift doth write.
2Thou fairer art than sons of men:
into thy lips is store
Of grace infus'd; God therefore thee
hath bless'd for evermore.
3O thou that art the mighty One,
thy sword gird on thy thigh;
Ev'n with thy glory excellent,
and with thy majesty.
4For meekness, truth, and righteousness,
in state ride prosp'rously;
And thy right hand shall thee instruct
in things that fearful be.
5Thine arrows sharply pierce the heart
of th' en'mies of the King;
And under thy subjection
the people down do bring.
6For ever and for ever is,
O God, thy throne of might;
The sceptre of thy kingdom is
a sceptre that is right.
7Thou lovest right, and hatest ill;
for God, thy God, most high,
Above thy fellows hath with th' oil
of joy anointed thee.
8Of aloes, myrrh,
and cassia, a smell thy garments had,
Out of the iv'ry palaces,
whereby they made thee glad.
9Among thy women honourable
kings' daughters were at hand:
Upon thy right hand did the queen
in gold of Ophir stand.
10O daughter, hearken and regard,
and do thine ear incline;
Likewise forget thy father's house,
and people that are thine.
11Then of the King desir'd shall be
thy beauty veh'mently:
Because he is thy Lord, do thou
him worship rev'rently.
12The daughter there of Tyre shall be
with gifts and off 'rings great:
Those of the people that are rich
thy favour shall entreat.
13Behold, the daughter of the King
all glorious is within;
And with embroideries of gold
her garments wrought have been.
14She shall be brought unto the King
in robes with needle wrought;
Her fellow-virgins following
shall unto thee be brought.
15They shall be brought with gladness great,
and mirth on ev'ry side,
Into the palace of the King,
and there they shall abide.
16Instead of those thy fathers dear,
thy children thou may'st take,
And in all places of the earth
them noble princes make.
17Thy name remember'd I will make
through ages all to be:
The people therefore evermore
shall praises give to thee.

PSALM 45b

1My heart inditing is
good matter in a song:
I speak the things that I have made,
which to the King belong:
My tongue shall be as quick,
his honour to indite,
As is the pen of any scribe
that useth fast to write.
2Thou'rt fairest of all men;
grace in thy lips doth flow:
And therefore blessings evermore
on thee doth God bestow.
3Thy sword gird on thy thigh,
thou that art most of might:
Appear in dreadful majesty,
and in thy glory bright.
4For meekness, truth, and right,
ride prosp'rously in state;
And thy right hand shall teach to thee
things terrible and great.
5Thy shafts shall pierce their hearts
that foes are to the King;
Whereby into subjection
the people thou shalt bring.
6Thy royal seat, O Lord,
for ever shall remain:
The sceptre of thy kingdom doth
all righteousness maintain.
7Thou lov'st right, and hat'st ill;
for God, thy God, most high,
Above thy fellows hath with th' oil
of joy anointed thee.
8Of myrrh and spices sweet
a smell thy garments had,
Out of the iv'ry palaces,
whereby they made thee glad.
9And in thy glorious train
kings' daughters waiting stand;
And thy fair queen, in Ophir gold,
doth stand at thy right hand.
10O daughter, take good heed,
incline, and give good ear;
Thou must forget thy kindred all,
and father's house most dear.
11Thy beauty to the King
shall then delightful be:
And do thou humbly worship him,
because thy Lord is he.
12The daughter then of Tyre
there with a gift shall be,
And all the wealthy of the land
shall make their suit to thee.
13The daughter of the King
all glorious is within;
And with embroideries of gold
her garments wrought have been.
14She cometh to the King
in robes with needle wrought;
The virgins that do follow her
shall unto thee be brought.
15They shall be brought with joy,
and mirth on ev'ry side,
Into the palace of the King,
and there they shall abide.
16And in thy fathers' stead,
thy children thou may'st take,
And in all places of the earth
them noble princes make.
17I will shew forth thy name
to generations all:
Therefore the people evermore
to thee give praises shall.

PSALM 46
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician, for the sons of Korah,
A Song upon Alomoth.
1God is our refuge and our strength,
in straits a present aid;
2Therefore, although the earth remove,
we will not be afraid:
Though hills amidst the seas be cast;
3Though waters roaring make,
And troubled be; yea, though the hills,
by swelling seas do shake.
4A river is, whose streams do glad
the city of our God;
The holy place, wherein the Lord
most high hath his abode.
5God in the midst of her doth dwell;
nothing shall her remove:
The Lord to her an helper will,
and that right early, prove.
6The heathen rag'd tumultuously,
the kingdoms moved were:
The Lord God uttered his voice,
the earth did melt for fear.
7The Lord of hosts upon our side
doth constantly remain:
The God of Jacob's our refuge,
us safely to maintain.
8Come, and behold what wondrous works
have by the Lord been wrought;
Come, see what desolations
he on the earth hath brought.
9Unto the ends of all the earth
wars into peace he turns:
The bow he breaks, the spear he cuts,
in fire the chariot burns.
10Be still, and know that I am God;
among the heathen I
Will be exalted; I on earth
will be exalted high.
11Our God, who is the Lord of hosts,
is still upon our side;
The God of Jacob our refuge
for ever will abide.

PSALM 47

3The heathen people under us
he surely shall subdue;
And he shall make the nations
under our feet to bow.
4The lot of our inheritance
chuse out for us shall he,
Of Jacob, whom he loved well,
ev'n the excellency.
5God is with shouts gone up, the Lord
with trumpets sounding high.
6Sing praise to God, sing praise, sing praise,
praise to our King sing ye.
7For God is King of all the earth;
with knowledge praise express.
8God rules the nations: God sits on
his throne of holiness.
9The princes of the people are
assembled willingly;
Ev'n of the God of Abraham
they who the people be.
For why? the shields that do defend
the earth are only his:
They to the Lord belong; yea, he
exalted greatly is.

PSALM 48
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
A Song and Psalm for the sons of Korah.
1Great is the Lord, and greatly he
is to be praised still,
Within the city of our God,
upon his holy hill.
2Mount Sion stands most beautiful,
the joy of all the land;
The city of the mighty King
on her north side doth stand.
3The Lord within her palaces
is for a refuge known.
4For, lo, the kings that gather'd were
together, by have gone.
5But when they did behold the same,
they, wond'ring, would not stay;
But, being troubled at the sight,
they thence did haste away.
6Great terror there took hold on them;
they were possess'd with fear;
Their grief came like a woman's pain,
when she a child doth bear.
7Thou Tarshish ships with east wind break'st:
8As we have heard it told,
So, in the city of the Lord,
our eyes did it behold;
In our God's city, which his hand
for ever stablish will.
9We of thy loving-kindness thought,
Lord, in thy temple still.
10O Lord, according to thy name,
through all the earth's thy praise;
And thy right hand, O Lord, is full
of righteousness always.
11Because thy judgments are made known,
let Sion mount rejoice;
Of Judah let the daughters all
send forth a cheerful voice.
12Walk about Sion,
and go round; the high tow'rs thereof tell:
13Consider ye her palaces,
and mark her bulwarks well;
That ye may tell posterity.
14For this God doth abide
Our God for evermore; he will
ev'n unto death us guide.

PSALM 49
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician,
A Psalm for the sons of Korah.
1Hear this, all people, and give ear,
all in the world that dwell;
2Both low and high, both rich and poor.
3My mouth shall wisdom tell:
My heart shall knowledge meditate.
4I will incline mine ear
To parables, and on the harp
my sayings dark declare.
5Amidst those days that evil be,
why should I, fearing, doubt?
When of my heels th' iniquity
shall compass me about.
6Whoe'er they be that in their wealth
their confidence do pitch,
And boast themselves, because they are
become exceeding rich:
7Yet none of these his brother can
redeem by any way;
Nor can he unto God for him
sufficient ransom pay,
8(Their soul's redemption precious is,
and it can never be,)
9That still he should for ever live,
and not corruption see.
10For why? he seeth that wise men die,
and brutish fools also
Do perish; and their wealth, when dead,
to others they let go.
11Their inward thought is, that their house
and dwelling-places shall
Stand through all ages; they their lands
by their own names do call.
12But yet in honour shall not man
abide continually;
But passing hence, may be compar'd
unto the beasts that die.
13Thus brutish folly plainly is
their wisdom and their way;
Yet their posterity approve
what they do fondly say.
14Like sheep they in the grave are laid,
and death shall them devour;
And in the morning upright men
shall over them have pow'r:
Their beauty from their dwelling shall
consume within the grave.
15But from hell's hand God will me free,
for he shall me receive.
16Be thou not then afraid when one
enriched thou dost see,
Nor when the glory of his house
advanced is on high:
17For he shall carry nothing hence
when death his days doth end;
Nor shall his glory after him
into the grave descend.
18Although he his own soul did bless
whilst he on earth did live;
(And when thou to thyself dost well,
men will thee praises give;)
19He to his fathers' race shall go,
they never shall see light.
20Man honour'd wanting knowledge is
like beasts that perish quite.

PSALM 50
First Version
Meter: 6,6,8,6
A Psalm of Asaph.
1The mighty God, the Lord,
hath spoken, and did call
The earth, from rising of the sun,
to where he hath his fall.
2From out of Sion hill,
which of excellency
And beauty the perfection is,
God shined gloriously.
3Our God shall surely come,
keep silence shall not he:
Before him fire shall waste, great storms
shall round about him be.
4Unto the heavens clear
he from above shall call,
And to the earth likewise, that he
may judge his people all.
5Together let my saints
unto me gather'd be,
Those that by sacrifice have made
a covenant with me.
6And then the heavens shall
his righteousness declare:
Because the Lord himself is he
by whom men judged are.
7My people Isr'el hear,
speak will I from on high,
Against thee I will testify;
God, ev'n thy God, am I.
8I for thy sacrifice
no blame will on thee lay,
Nor for burnt-off 'rings, which to me
thou offer'dst ev'ry day.
9I'll take no calf nor goats
from house or fold of thine:
10For beasts of forests, cattle all
on thousand hills, are mine.
11The fowls on mountains high
are all to me well known;
Wild beasts which in the fields do lie,
ev'n they are all mine own.
12Then, if I hungry were,
I would not tell it thee;
Because the world, and fulness all
thereof, belongs to me.
13Will I eat flesh of bulls?
or goats' blood drink will I?
14Thanks offer thou to God, and pay
thy vows to the most High.
15And call upon me when
in trouble thou shalt be;
I will deliver thee, and thou
my name shalt glorify.
16But to the wicked man
God saith, My laws and truth
Should'st thou declare? how dar'st thou take
my cov'nant in thy mouth?
17Sith thou instruction hat'st,
which should thy ways direct;
And sith my words behind thy back
thou cast'st, and dost reject.
18When thou a thief didst see,
with him thou didst consent;
And with the vile adulterers
partaker on thou went.
19Thou giv'st thy mouth to ill,
thy tongue deceit doth frame;
20Thou sitt'st, and 'gainst thy brother speak'st,
thy mother's son dost shame.
21Because I silence kept,
while thou these things hast wrought;
That I was altogether like
thyself, hath been thy thought;
Yet I will thee reprove,
and set before thine eyes,
In order ranked, thy misdeeds
and thine iniquities.
22Now, ye that God forget,
this carefully consider;
Lest I in pieces tear you all,
and none can you deliver.
23Whoso doth offer praise
me glorifies; and I
Will shew him God's salvation,
that orders right his way.

1The mighty God, the Lord, hath spoke,
and call'd the earth upon,
Ev'n from the rising of the sun
unto his going down.
2From out of Sion, his own hill,
where the perfection high
Of beauty is, from thence the Lord
hath shined gloriously.
3Our God shall come, and shall no more
be silent, but speak out;
Before him fire shall waste, great storms
shall compass him about.
4He to the heavens from above,
and to the earth below,
Shall call, that he his judgments may
before his people show.
5Let all my saints together be
unto me gathered;
Those that by sacrifice with me
a covenant have made.
6And then the heavens shall declare
his righteousness abroad;
Because the Lord himself doth come;
none else is judge but God.
7Hear, O my people, and I'll speak;
O Israel by name,
Against thee I will testify;
God, ev'n thy God, I am.
8I for thy sacrifices few
reprove thee never will,
Nor for burnt-off 'rings to have been
before me offer'd still.
9I'll take no bullock nor he-goats
from house nor folds of thine:
10For beasts of forests, cattle all
on thousand hills, are mine.
11The fowls are all to me well known
that mountains high do yield;
And I do challenge as mine own
the wild beasts of the field.
12If I were hungry, I would not
to thee for need complain;
For earth, and all its fulness, doth
to me of right pertain.
13That I to eat the flesh of bulls
take pleasure dost thou think?
Or that I need, to quench my thirst,
the blood of goats to drink?
14Nay, rather unto me, thy God,
thanksgiving offer thou:
To the most High perform thy word,
and fully pay thy vow:
15And in the day of trouble great
see that thou call on me;
I will deliver thee, and thou
my name shalt glorify.
16But God unto the wicked saith,
Why should'st thou mention make
Of my commands? how dar'st thou in
thy mouth my cov'nant take?
17Sith it is so that thou dost hate
all good instruction;
And sith thou cast'st behind thy back,
and slight'st my words each one.
18When thou a thief didst see, then straight
thou join'dst with him in sin,
And with the vile adulterers
thou hast partaker been.
19Thy mouth to evil thou dost give,
thy tongue deceit doth frame
20Thou sitt'st, and 'gainst thy brother speak'st,
thy mother's son to shame.
21These things thou wickedly hast done,
and I have silent been:
Thou thought'st that I was like thyself,
and did approve thy sin;
But I will sharply thee reprove,
and I will order right
Thy sins and thy transgressions
in presence of thy sight.
22Consider this, and be afraid,
ye that forget the Lord,
Lest I in pieces tear you all,
when none can help afford.
23Who off'reth praise me glorifies:
I will shew God's salvation
To him that ordereth aright
his life and conversation.

1After thy loving-kindness, Lord,
have mercy upon me:
For thy compassions great, blot out
all mine iniquity.
2Me cleanse from sin, and throughly wash
from mine iniquity:
3For my transgressions I confess;
my sin I ever see.
4'Gainst thee, thee only, have I sinn'd,
in thy sight done this ill;
That when thou speak'st thou may'st be just,
and clear in judging still.
5Behold, I in iniquity
was form'd the womb within;
My mother also me conceiv'd
in guiltiness and sin.
6Behold, thou in the inward parts
with truth delighted art;
And wisdom thou shalt make me know
within the hidden part.
7Do thou with hyssop sprinkle me,
I shall be cleansed so;
Yea, wash thou me, and then I shall
be whiter than the snow.
8Of gladness and of joyfulness
make me to hear the voice;
That so these very bones which thou
hast broken may rejoice.
9All mine iniquities blot out,
thy face hide from my sin.
10Create a clean heart, Lord, renew
a right sp'rit me within.
11Cast me not from thy sight, nor take
thy Holy Sp'rit away.
12Restore me thy salvation's joy;
with thy free Sp'rit me stay.
13Then will I teach thy ways unto
those that transgressors be;
And those that sinners are shall then
be turned unto thee.
14O God, of my salvation God,
me from blood-guiltiness
Set free; then shall my tongue aloud
sing of thy righteousness.
15My closed lips, O Lord, by thee
let them be opened;
Then shall thy praises by my mouth
abroad be published.
16For thou desir'st not sacrifice,
else would I give it thee;
Nor wilt thou with burnt-offering
at all delighted be.
17A broken spirit is to God
a pleasing sacrifice:
A broken and a contrite heart,
Lord, thou wilt not despise.
18Shew kindness, and do good, O Lord,
to Sion, thine own hill:
The walls of thy Jerusalem
build up of thy good will.
19Then righteous off 'rings shall thee please,
and off 'rings burnt, which they
With whole burnt-off 'rings,
and with calves, shall on thine altar lay.

1Why dost thou boast, O mighty man,
of mischief and of ill?
The goodness of Almighty God
endureth ever still.
2Thy tongue mischievous calumnies
deviseth subtilely,
Like to a razor sharp to cut,
working deceitfully.
3Ill more than good, and more than truth
thou lovest to speak wrong:
4Thou lovest all-devouring words,
O thou deceitful tongue.
5So God shall thee destroy for aye,
remove thee, pluck thee out
Quite from thy house, out of the land
of life he shall thee root.
6The righteous shall it see, and fear,
and laugh at him they shall:
7Lo, this the man is that did not
make God his strength at all:
But he in his abundant wealth
his confidence did place;
And he took strength unto himself
from his own wickedness.
8But I am in the house of God
like to an olive green:
My confidence for ever hath
upon God's mercy been.

because thou hast done this:
I on thy name will wait; for good

They are corrupt, their works are vile,
not one of them doth good.
2The Lord upon the sons of men
from heav'n did cast his eyes,
To see if any one there was
that sought God, and was wise.
3They altogether filthy are,
they all are backward gone;
And there is none that doeth good,
no, not so much as one.
4These workers of iniquity,
do they not know at all,
That they my people eat as bread,
and on God do not call?
5Ev'n there they were afraid, and stood
with trembling, all dismay'd,
Whereas there was no cause at all
why they should be afraid:
For God his bones that thee besieg'd
hath scatter'd all abroad;
Thou hast confounded them, for they
despised are of God.

when back the Lord shall bring
His captives, Jacob shall rejoice,

2My prayer hear, O God; give ear

3For they that strangers are to me

Oppressors seek my soul, and God

4The Lord my God my helper is,
lo, therefore I am bold:
He taketh part with ev'ry one
that doth my soul uphold.
5Unto mine enemies he shall
mischief and ill repay:
O for thy truth's sake cut them off,
and sweep them clean away.
6I will a sacrifice to thee
give with free willingness;
Thy name, O Lord, because 'tis good,

And his desire mine eye hath seen

A Psalm of David.
1Lord, hear my pray'r, hide not thyself
from my entreating voice:
2Attend and hear me; in my plaint
I mourn and make a noise.
3Because of th' en'my's voice, and for
lewd men's oppression great:
On me they cast iniquity,
and they in wrath me hate.
4Sore pain'd within me is my heart:
death's terrors on me fall.
5On me comes trembling, fear and dread
o'erwhelmed me withal.
6O that I, like a dove, had wings,
said I, then would I flee
Far hence, that I might find a place
where I in rest might be.
7Lo, then far off I wander would,
and in the desert stay;
8From windy storm and tempest I
would haste to 'scape away.
9O Lord, on them destruction bring,
and do their tongues divide;
For in the city violence
and strife I have espy'd.
10They day and night upon the walls
do go about it round:
There mischief is, and sorrow there
in midst of it is found.
11Abundant wickedness there is
within her inward part;
And from her streets deceitfulness
and guile do not depart.
12He was no foe that me reproach'd,
then that endure I could;
Nor hater that did 'gainst me boast,
from him me hide I would.
13But thou, man, who mine equal, guide,
and mine acquaintance wast:
14We join'd sweet counsels, to God's house
in company we past.
15Let death upon them seize, and down
let them go quick to hell;
For wickedness doth much abound
among them where they dwell.
16I'll call on God: God will me save.
17I'll pray, and make a noise
At ev'ning, morning, and at noon;
and he shall hear my voice.
18He hath my soul delivered,
that it in peace might be
From battle that against me was;
for many were with me.
19The Lord shall hear, and them afflict,
of old who hath abode:
Because they never changes have,
therefore they fear not God.
20'Gainst those that were at peace with him
he hath put forth his hand:
The covenant that he had made,
by breaking he profan'd.
21More smooth than butter were his words,
while in his heart was war;
His speeches were more soft than oil,
and yet drawn swords they are.
22Cast thou thy burden on the Lord,
and he shall thee sustain;
Yea, he shall cause the righteous man
unmoved to remain.
23But thou, O Lord my God, those men
in justice shalt o'erthrow,
And in destruction's dungeon dark
at last shalt lay them low:
The bloody and deceitful men
shall not live half their days:
But upon thee with confidence
I will depend always.

PSALM 56
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician upon Jonath-elem-rechokim,
Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath.
1Shew mercy, Lord, to me, for man
would swallow me outright;
He me oppresseth, while he doth
against me daily fight.
2They daily would me swallow up
that hate me spitefully;
For they be many that do fight
against me, O most High.
3When I'm afraid I'll trust in thee:
4In God I'll praise his word;
I will not fear what flesh can do,
my trust is in the Lord.
5Each day they wrest my words; their thoughts
'gainst me are all for ill.
6They meet, they lurk, they mark my steps,
waiting my soul to kill.
7But shall they by iniquity
escape thy judgments so?
O God, with indignation down
do thou the people throw.
8My wand'rings all what they have been
thou know'st, their number took;
Into thy bottle put my tears:
are they not in thy book?
9My foes shall, when I cry, turn back;
I know't, God is for me.
10In God his word I'll praise; his word
in God shall praised be.
11In God I trust; I will not fear
what man can do to me.
12Thy vows upon me are, O God:
I'll render praise to thee.
13Wilt thou not, who from death me sav'd,
my feet from falls keep free,
To walk before God in the light
of those that living be?

PSALM 57
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician, Al-taschith,
Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave.
1Be merciful to me, O God;
thy mercy unto me
Do thou extend; because my soul
doth put her trust in thee:
Yea, in the shadow of thy wings
my refuge I will place,
Until these sad calamities
do wholly overpass.
2My cry I will cause to ascend
unto the Lord most high;
To God, who doth all things for me
perform most perfectly.
3From heav'n he shall send down, and me
from his reproach defend
That would devour me: God his truth
and mercy forth shall send.
4My soul among fierce lions is,
I firebrands live among,
Men's sons, whose teeth are spears and darts,
a sharp sword is their tongue.
5Be thou exalted very high
above the heav'ns, O God;
Let thou thy glory be advanc'd
o'er all the earth abroad.
6My soul's bow'd down; for they a net
have laid, my steps to snare:
Into the pit which they have digg'd
for me, they fallen are.
7My heart is fix'd, my heart is fix'd,
O God; I'll sing and praise.
8My glory wake; wake psalt'ry, harp;
myself I'll early raise.
9I'll praise thee 'mong the people, Lord;
'mong nations sing will I:
10For great to heav'n thy mercy is,
thy truth is to the sky.
11O Lord, exalted be thy name
above the heav'ns to stand:
Do thou thy glory far advance
above both sea and land.

PSALM 58
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician, Al-taschith,
Michtam of David.
1Do ye, O congregation,
indeed speak righteousness?
O ye that are the sons of men,
judge ye with uprightness?
2Yea, ev'n within your very hearts
ye wickedness have done;
And ye the vi'lence of your hands
do weigh the earth upon.
3The wicked men estranged are,
ev'n from the very womb;
They, speaking lies, do stray as soon
as to the world they come.
4Unto a serpent's poison like
their poison doth appear;
Yea, they are like the adder deaf,
that closely stops her ear;
5That so she may not hear the voice
of one that charm her would,
No, not though he most cunning were,
and charm most wisely could.
6Their teeth, O God, within their mouth
break thou in pieces small;
The great teeth break thou out, O Lord,
of these young lions all.
7Let them like waters melt away,
which downward still do flow:
In pieces cut his arrows all,
when he shall bend his bow.
8Like to a snail that melts away,
let each of them be gone;
Like woman's birth untimely, that
they never see the sun.
9He shall them take away before
your pots the thorns can find,
Both living, and in fury great,
as with a stormy wind.
10The righteous, when he vengeance sees,
he shall be joyful then;
The righteous one shall wash his feet
in blood of wicked men.
11So men shall say, The righteous man
reward shall never miss:
And verily upon the earth
a God to judge there is.

PSALM 59
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician, Al-taschith,
Michtam of David; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.
1My God, deliver me from those
that are mine enemies;
And do thou me defend from those
that up against me rise.
2Do thou deliver me from them
that work iniquity;
And give me safety from the men
of bloody cruelty.
3For, lo, they for my soul lay wait:
the mighty do combine
Against me, Lord; not for my fault,
nor any sin of mine.
4They run, and, without fault in me,
themselves do ready make:
Awake to meet me with thy help;
and do thou notice take.
5Awake therefore, Lord God of hosts,
thou God of Israel,
To visit heathen all: spare none
that wickedly rebel.
6At ev'ning they go to and fro;
they make great noise and sound,
Like to a dog, and often walk
about the city round.
7Behold, they belch out with their mouth,
and in their lips are swords:
For they do say thus, Who is he
that now doth hear our words?
8But thou, O Lord, shalt laugh at them,
and all the heathen mock.
9While he's in pow'r I'll wait on thee;
for God is my high rock.
10He of my mercy that is God
betimes shall me prevent;
Upon mine en'mies God shall let
me see mine heart's content.
11Them slay not, lest my folk forget;
but scatter them abroad
By thy strong pow'r; and bring them down,
O thou our shield and God.
12For their mouth's sin, and for the words
that from their lips do fly,
Let them be taken in their pride;
because they curse and lie.
13In wrath consume them, them consume,
that so they may not be:
And that in Jacob God doth rule
to th' earth's ends let them see.
14At ev'ning let thou them return,
making great noise and sound,
Like to a dog, and often walk
about the city round.
15And let them wander up and down,
in seeking food to eat;
And let them grudge when they shall not
be satisfy'd with meat.
16But of thy pow'r I'll sing aloud;
at morn thy mercy praise:
For thou to me my refuge wast,
and tow'r, in troublous days.
17O God, thou art my strength, I will
sing praises unto thee;
For God is my defence, a God
of mercy unto me.

PSALM 60
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician upon Shushan-eduth,
Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aram-naharaim, and with Aram-zobah, when Joab returned and smote of Edom, in the valley of Salt, twelve thousand.
1O Lord, thou hast rejected us,
and scatter'd us abroad;
Thou justly hast displeased been;
return to us, O God.
2The earth to tremble thou hast made;
therein didst breaches make:
Do thou thereof the breaches heal,
because the land doth shake.
3Unto thy people thou hard things hast shew'd,
and on them sent;
And thou hast caused us to drink
wine of astonishment.
4And yet a banner thou hast giv'n
to them who thee do fear;
That it by them, because of truth,
displayed may appear.
5That thy beloved people may
deliver'd be from thrall,
Save with the pow'r of thy right hand,
and hear me when I call.
6God in his holiness hath spoke;
herein I will take pleasure:
Shechem I will divide, and forth
will Succoth's valley measure.
7Gilead I claim as mine by right;
Manasseh mine shall be;
Ephraim is of mine head the strength;
Judah gives laws for me;
8Moab's my washing-pot; my shoe
I'll over Edom throw;
And over Palestina's land
I will in triumph go.
9O who is he will bring me to
the city fortify'd?
O who is he that to the land
of Edom will me guide?
10O God, which hadest us cast off,
this thing wilt thou not do?
Ev'n thou, O God, which didest not
forth with our armies go?
11Help us from trouble; for the help
is vain which man supplies.
12Through God we'll do great acts; he shall
tread down our enemies.

PSALM 61
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician upon Neginoth,
A Psalm of David.
1O God, give ear unto my cry;
unto my pray'r attend.
2From th' utmost corner of the land
my cry to thee I'll send.
What time my heart is overwhelm'd,
and in perplexity,
Do thou me lead unto the Rock
that higher is than I.
3For thou hast for my refuge been
a shelter by thy pow'r;
And for defence against my foes
thou hast been a strong tow'r.
4Within thy tabernacle I
for ever will abide;
And under covert of thy wings
with confidence me hide.
5For thou the vows that I did make,
O Lord my God, didst hear:
Thou hast giv'n me the heritage
of those thy name that fear.
6A life prolong'd for many days
thou to the king shalt give;
Like many generations be
the years which he shall live.
7He in God's presence his abode
for evermore shall have:
O do thou truth and mercy both
prepare, that may him save.
8And so will I perpetually
sing praise unto thy name;
That having made my vows, I may
each day perform the same.

PSALM 62
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun,
A Psalm of David.
1My soul with expectation
depends on God indeed;
My strength and my salvation doth
from him alone proceed.
2He only my salvation is,
and my strong rock is he:
He only is my sure defence;
much mov'd I shall not be.
3How long will ye against a man
plot mischief? ye shall all
Be slain; ye as a tott'ring fence shall be,
and bowing wall.
4They only plot to cast him down
from his excellency:
They joy in lies; with mouth they bless,
but they curse inwardly.
5My soul, wait thou with patience
upon thy God alone;
On him dependeth all my hope
and expectation.
6He only my salvation is,
and my strong rock is he;
He only is my sure defence:
I shall not moved be.
7In God my glory placed is,
and my salvation sure;
In God the rock is of my strength,
my refuge most secure.
8Ye people, place your confidence
in him continually;
Before him pour ye out your heart:
God is our refuge high.
9Surely mean men are vanity,
and great men are a lie;
In balance laid, they wholly are
more light than vanity.
10Trust ye not in oppression,
in robb'ry be not vain;
On wealth set not your hearts, when as
increased is your gain.
11God hath it spoken once to me,
yea, this I heard again,
That power to Almighty God
alone doth appertain.
12Yea, mercy also unto thee
belongs, O Lord, alone:
For thou according to his work
rewardest ev'ry one.

PSALM 63
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.
1Lord, thee my God, I'll early seek:
my soul doth thirst for thee;
My flesh longs in a dry parch'd land,
wherein no waters be:
2That I thy power may behold,
and brightness of thy face,
As I have seen thee heretofore
within thy holy place.
3Since better is thy love than life,
my lips thee praise shall give.
4I in thy name will lift my hands,
and bless thee while I live.
5Ev'n as with marrow and with fat
my soul shall filled be;
Then shall my mouth with joyful lips
sing praises unto thee:
6When I do thee upon my bed
remember with delight,
And when on thee I meditate
in watches of the night.
7In shadow of thy wings I'll joy;
for thou mine help hast been.
8My soul thee follows hard; and me
thy right hand doth sustain.
9Who seek my soul to spill shall sink
down to earth's lowest room.
10They by the sword shall be cut off,
and foxes' prey become.
11Yet shall the king in God rejoice,
and each one glory shall
That swear by him: but stopp'd shall be
the mouth of liars all.

PSALM 64
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician,
A Psalm of David.
1When I to thee my prayer make,
Lord, to my voice give ear;
My life save from the enemy,
of whom I stand in fear.
2Me from their secret counsel hide
who do live wickedly;
From insurrection of those men
that work iniquity:
3Who do their tongues with malice whet,
and make them cut like swords;
In whose bent bows are arrows set,
ev'n sharp and bitter words:
4That they may at the perfect man
in secret aim their shot;
Yea, suddenly they dare at him to shoot,
and fear it not.
5In ill encourage they themselves,
and their snares close do lay:
Together conference they have;
Who shall them see? they say.
6They have search'd out iniquities,
a perfect search they keep:
Of each of them the inward thought,
and very heart, is deep.
7God shall an arrow shoot at them,
and wound them suddenly:
8So their own tongue shall them confound;
all who them see shall fly.
9And on all men a fear shall fall,
God's works they shall declare;
For they shall wisely notice take
what these his doings are.
10In God the righteous shall rejoice,
and trust upon his might;
Yea, they shall greatly glory all
in heart that are upright.

PSALM 65
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Praise waits for thee in Sion, Lord:
to thee vows paid shall be.
2O thou that hearer art of pray'r,
all flesh shall come to thee.
3Iniquities, I must confess,
prevail against me do:
But as for our transgressions,
them purge away shalt thou.
4Bless'd is the man whom thou dost chuse,
and mak'st approach to thee,
That he within thy courts, O Lord,
may still a dweller be:
We surely shall be satisfy'd
with thy abundant grace,
And with the goodness of thy house,
ev'n of thy holy place.
5O God of our salvation,
thou, in thy righteousness,
By fearful works unto our pray'rs
thine answer dost express:
Therefore the ends of all the earth,
and those afar that be
Upon the sea, their confidence,
O Lord, will place in thee.
6Who, being girt with pow'r, sets fast
by his great strength the hills.
7Who noise of seas, noise of their waves,
and people's tumult, stills.
8Those in the utmost parts that dwell
are at thy signs afraid:
Th' outgoings of the morn and ev'n
by thee are joyful made.
9The earth thou visit'st, wat'ring it;
thou mak'st it rich to grow
With God's full flood; thou corn prepar'st,
when thou provid'st it so.
10Her rigs thou wat'rest plenteously,
her furrows settelest:
With show'rs thou dost her mollify,
her spring by thee is blest.
11So thou the year most lib'rally
dost with thy goodness crown;
And all thy paths abundantly
on us drop fatness down.
12They drop upon the pastures wide,
that do in deserts lie;
The little hills on ev'ry side
rejoice right pleasantly.
13With flocks the pastures clothed be,
the vales with corn are clad;
And now they shout and sing to thee,
for thou hast made them glad.

PSALM 66
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1All lands to God in joyful sounds,
aloft your voices raise.
2Sing forth the honour of his name,
and glorious make his praise.
3Say unto God, How terrible
in all thy works art thou!
Through thy great pow'r thy foes to thee
shall be constrain'd to bow.
4All on the earth shall worship thee,
they shall thy praise proclaim
In songs: they shall sing cheerfully
unto thy holy name.
5Come, and the works that God hath wrought
with admiration see:
In's working to the sons of men
most terrible is he.
6Into dry land the sea he turn'd,
and they a passage had;
Ev'n marching through the flood on foot,
there we in him were glad.
7He ruleth ever by his pow'r;
his eyes the nations see:
O let not the rebellious ones
lift up themselves on high.
8Ye people, bless our God; aloud
the voice speak of his praise:
9Our soul in life who safe preserves,
our foot from sliding stays.
10For thou didst prove and try us, Lord,
as men do silver try;
11Brought'st us into the net,
and mad'st bands on our loins to lie.
12Thou hast caus'd men ride o'er our heads;
and though that we did pass
Through fire and water, yet thou brought'st
us to a wealthy place.
13I'll bring burnt off 'rings to thy house;
to thee my vows I'll pay,
14Which my lips utter'd, my mouth spake,
when trouble on me lay.
15Burnt-sacrifices of fat rams
with incense I will bring;
Of bullocks and of goats I will
present an offering.
16All that fear God, come, hear, I'll tell
what he did for my soul.
17I with my mouth unto him cry'd,
my tongue did him extol.
18If in my heart I sin regard,
the Lord me will not hear:
19But surely God me heard,
and to my prayer's voice gave ear.
20O let the Lord, our gracious God,
for ever blessed be,
Who turned not my pray'r from him,
nor yet his grace from me.

And graciously cause shine on us

Also among the nations all

3O let the people praise thee, Lord;
let people all thee praise.
4O let the nations be glad,

For rightly thou shalt people judge,

5Let people praise thee, Lord; let all

PSALM 68
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician,
A Psalm or Song of David.
1Let God arise, and scatterÃ¨d
let all his en'mies be;
And let all those that do him hate
before his presence flee.
2As smoke is driv'n, so drive thou them;
as fire melts wax away,
Before God's face let wicked men
so perish and decay.
3But let the righteous be glad:
let them before God's sight
Be very joyful; yea, let them
rejoice with all their might.
4To God sing, to his name sing praise;
extol him with your voice,
That rides on heav'n, by his name Jah,
before his face rejoice.
5Because the Lord a father is
unto the fatherless;
God is the widow's judge, within
his place of holiness.
6God doth the solitary set
in fam'lies: and from bands
The chain'd doth free; but rebels do
inhabit parched lands.
7O God, what time thou didst go forth
before thy people's face;
And when through the great wilderness
thy glorious marching was;
8Then at God's presence shook the earth,
then drops from heaven fell;
This Sinai shook before the Lord,
the God of Israel.
9O God, thou to thine heritage
didst send a plenteous rain,
Whereby thou, when it weary was,
didst it refresh again.
10Thy congregation then did make
their habitation there:
Of thine own goodness for the poor,
O God, thou didst prepare.
11The Lord himself did give the word,
the word abroad did spread;
Great was the company of them
the same who published.
12Kings of great armies foiled were,
and forced to flee away;
And women, who remained at home,
did distribute the prey.
13Though ye have lien among the pots,
like doves ye shall appear,
Whose wings with silver, and with gold
whose feathers covered are.
14When there th' Almighty scatter'd kings,
like Salmon's snow 'twas white.
15God's hill is like to Bashan hill,
like Bashan hill for height.
16Why do ye leap, ye mountains high?
this is the hill where God
Desires to dwell; yea, God in it
for aye will make abode.
17God's chariots twenty thousand are,
thousands of angels strong;
In's holy place God is, as in
mount Sinai, them among.
18Thou hast, O Lord, most glorious,
ascended up on high;
And in triumph victorious led
captive captivity:
Thou hast received gifts for men,
for such as did rebel;
Yea, ev'n for them, that God the Lord
in midst of them might dwell.
19Blessed be the Lord, who is to us
of our salvation God;
Who daily with his benefits
us plenteously doth load.
20He of salvation is the God,
who is our God most strong;
And unto God the Lord from death
the issues do belong.
21But surely God shall wound the head
of those that are his foes;
The hairy scalp of him that still
on in his trespass goes.
22God said, My people I will bring
again from Bashan hill;
Yea, from the sea's devouring depths
them bring again I will;
23That in the blood of enemies
thy foot imbrued may be,
And of thy dogs dipped in the same
the tongues thou mayest see.
24Thy goings they have seen, O God;
the steps of majesty
Of my God, and my mighty King,
within the sanctuary.
25Before went singers, players next
on instruments took way;
And them among the damsels were
that did on timbrels play.
26Within the congregations
bless God with one accord:
From Isr'el's fountain do ye bless
and praise the mighty Lord.
27With their prince, little Benjamin,
princes and council there
Of Judah were, there Zabulon's
and Napht'li's princes were.
28Thy God commands thy strength; make strong
what thou wrought'st for us, Lord.
29For thy house at Jerusalem
kings shall thee gifts afford.
30The spearmen's host, the multitude
of bulls, which fiercely look,
Those calves which people have forth sent,
O Lord our God, rebuke,
Till ev'ry one submit himself,
and silver pieces bring:
The people that delight in war
disperse, O God and King.
31Those that be princes great shall then
come out of Egypt lands;
And Ethiopia to God
shall soon stretch out her hands.
32O all ye kingdoms of the earth,
sing praises to this King;
For he is Lord that ruleth all,
unto him praises sing.
33To him that rides on heav'ns of heav'ns,
which he of old did found;
Lo, he sends out his voice, a voice
in might that doth abound.
34Strength unto God do ye ascribe;
for his excellency
Is over Israel, his strength
is in the clouds most high.
35Thou'rt from thy temple dreadful, Lord;
Isr'el's own God is he,
Who gives his people strength and pow'r:
O let God blessed be.

PSALM 69
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim,
A Psalm of David.
1Save me, O God, because the floods
do so environ me,
That ev'n unto my very soul
come in the waters be.
2I downward in deep mire do sink,
where standing there is none:
I am into deep waters come,
where floods have o'er me gone.
3I weary with my crying am,
my throat is also dry'd;
Mine eyes do fail, while for my God
I waiting do abide.
4Those men that do without a cause
bear hatred unto me,
Than are the hairs upon my head
in number more they be:
They that would me destroy, and are
mine en'mies wrongfully,
Are mighty: so what I took not,
to render forc'd was I.
5Lord, thou my folly know'st, my sins
not cover'd are from thee.
6Let none that wait on thee be sham'd,
Lord God of hosts, for me.
O Lord, the God of Israel,
let none, who search do make,
And seek thee, be at any time
confounded for my sake.
7For I have borne reproach for thee,
my face is hid with shame.
8To brethren strange, to mother's sons
an alien I became.
9Because the zeal did eat me up,
which to thine house I bear;
And the reproaches cast at thee,
upon me fallen are.
10My tears and fasts, t' afflict my soul,
were turned to my shame.
11When sackcloth I did wear, to them
a proverb I became.
12The men that in the gate do sit
against me evil spake;
They also that vile drunkards were
of me their song did make.
13But, in an acceptable time,
my pray'r, Lord, is to thee:
In truth of thy salvation, Lord,
and mercy great, hear me.
14Deliver me out of the mire,
from sinking do me keep;
Free me from those that do me hate,
and from the waters deep.
15Let not the flood on me prevail,
whose water overflows;
Nor deep me swallow, nor the pit
her mouth upon me close.
16Hear me, O Lord, because thy love
and kindness is most good;
Turn unto me, according to
thy mercies' multitude.
17Nor from thy servant hide thy face:
I'm troubled, soon attend.
18Draw near my soul, and it redeem;
me from my foes defend.
19To thee is my reproach well known,
my shame, and my disgrace:
Those that mine adversaries be
are all before thy face.
20Reproach hath broke my heart; I'm full
of grief: I look'd for one
To pity me, but none I found;
comforters found I none.
21They also bitter gall did give
unto me for my meat:
They gave me vinegar to drink,
when as my thirst was great.
22Before them let their table prove
a snare; and do thou make
Their welfare and prosperity
a trap themselves to take.
23Let thou their eyes so darken'd be,
that sight may them forsake;
And let their loins be made by thee
continually to shake.
24Thy fury pour thou out on them,
and indignation;
And let thy wrathful anger, Lord,
fast hold take them upon.
25All waste and desolate let be
their habitation;
And in their tabernacles all
inhabitants be none.
26Because him they do persecute,
whom thou didst smite before;
They talk unto the grief of those
whom thou hast wounded sore.
27Add thou iniquity unto
their former wickedness;
And do not let them come at all
into thy righteousness.
28Out of the book of life let them
be raz'd and blotted quite;
Among the just and righteous
let not their names be writ.
29But now become exceeding poor
and sorrowful am I:
By thy salvation, O my God,
let me be set on high.
30The name of God I with a song
most cheerfully will praise;
And I, in giving thanks to him,
his name shall highly raise.
31This to the Lord a sacrifice
more gracious shall prove
Than bullock, ox, or any beast
that hath both horn and hoof.
32When this the humble men shall see,
it joy to them shall give:
O all ye that do seek the Lord,
your hearts shall ever live.
33For God the poor hears, and will not
his prisoners contemn.
34Let heav'n, and earth, and seas, him praise,
and all that move in them.
35For God will Judah's cities build,
and he will Sion save,
That they may dwell therein,
and it in sure possession have.
36And they that are his servants' seed
inherit shall the same;
So shall they have their dwelling there
that love his blessed name.

PSALM 70

To the chief Musician,
A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance.
1Lord, haste me to deliver; with speed,
Lord, succor me.
2Let them that for my soul do seek
shamed and confounded be:
Turned back be they, and shamed,
that in my hurt delight.
3Turned back be they, Ha, ha! that say,
their shaming to requite.
4In thee let all be glad,
and joy that seek for thee:
Let them who thy salvation love
say still, God praisÃ¨d be.
5I poor and needy am; come, Lord,
and make no stay:
My help thou and deliv'rer art;
O Lord, make no delay.

1Make haste, O God, me to preserve;
with speed, Lord, succour me
2Let them that for my soul do seek
sham'd and confounded be:
Let them be turned back, and sham'd,
that in my hurt delight
3Turn'd back be they, Ha, ha! that say,
their shaming to requite.
4O Lord, in thee let all be glad,
and joy that seek for thee:
Let them who thy salvation love
say still, God praised be.
5But I both poor and needy am;
come, Lord, and make no stay:
My help thou and deliv'rer art;
O Lord, make no delay.

PSALM 71
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1O Lord, my hope and confidence
is plac'd in thee alone;
Then let thy servant never be
put to confusion.
2And let me, in thy righteousness,
from thee deliv'rance have;
Cause me escape, incline thine ear unto me,
and me save.
3Be thou my dwelling-rock, to which
I ever may resort:
Thou gav'st commandment me to save,
for thou'rt my rock and fort.
4Free me, my God, from wicked hands,
hands cruel and unjust:
5For thou, O Lord God, art my hope,
and from my youth my trust.
6Thou from the womb didst hold me up;
thou art the same that me
Out of my mother's bowels took;
I ever will praise thee.
7To many I a wonder am;
but thou'rt my refuge strong.
8Fill'd let my mouth be with thy praise
and honour all day long.
9O do not cast me off, when as
old age doth overtake me;
And when my strength decayed is,
then do not thou forsake me.
10For those that are mine enemies
against me speak with hate;
And they together counsel take
that for my soul lay wait.
11They said, God leaves him; him pursue
and take: none will him save.
12Be thou not far from me, my God:
thy speedy help I crave.
13Confound, consume them, that unto
my soul are enemies:
Cloth'd be they with reproach and shame
that do my hurt devise.
14But I with expectation
will hope continually;
And yet with praises more and more
I will thee magnify.
15Thy justice and salvation
my mouth abroad shall show,
Ev'n all the day; for I thereof
the numbers do not know.
16And I will constantly go on
in strength of God the Lord;
And thine own righteousness, ev'n thine
alone, I will record.
17For even from my youth, O God,
by thee I have been taught;
And hitherto I have declar'd
the wonders thou hast wrought.
18And now, Lord, leave me not, when I
old and gray-headed grow:
Till to this age thy strength and pow'r
to all to come I show.
19And thy most perfect righteousness
O Lord, is very high,
Who hast so great things done: O God,
who is like unto thee?
20Thou, Lord, who great adversities,
and sore, to me didst show,
Shalt quicken, and bring me again
from depths of earth below.
21My greatness and my pow'r thou wilt
increase, and far extend:
On ev'ry side against all grief
thou wilt me comfort send.
22Thee, ev'n thy truth, I'll also praise,
my God, with psaltery:
Thou Holy One of Israel,
with harp I'll sing to thee.
23My lips shall much rejoice in thee,
when I thy praises sound;
My soul, which thou redeemed hast,
in joy shall much abound.
24My tongue thy justice shall proclaim,
continuing all day long;
For they confounded are, and sham'd,
that seek to do me wrong.

PSALM 72
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
A Psalm for Solomon.
1O Lord, thy judgments give the king,
his son thy righteousness.
2With right he shall thy people judge,
thy poor with uprightness.
3The lofty mountains shall bring forth
unto the people peace;
Likewise the little hills the same
shall do by righteousness.
4The people's poor ones he shall judge,
the needy's children save;
And those shall he in pieces break
who them oppressed have.
5They shall thee fear, while sun and moon
do last, through ages all.
6Like rain on mown grass he shall drop,
or show'rs on earth that fall.
7The just shall flourish in his days,
and prosper in his reign:
He shall, while doth the moon endure,
abundant peace maintain.
8His large and great dominion shall
from sea to sea extend:
It from the river shall reach forth
unto earth's utmost end.
9They in the wilderness that dwell
bow down before him must;
And they that are his enemies
shall lick the very dust.
10The kings of Tarshish, and the isles,
to him shall presents bring;
And unto him shall offer gifts
Sheba's and Seba's king.
11Yea, all the mighty kings on earth
before him down shall fall;
And all the nations of the world
do service to him shall.
12For he the needy shall preserve,
when he to him doth call;
The poor also, and him that hath
no help of man at all.
13The poor man and the indigent
in mercy he shall spare;
He shall preserve alive the souls
of those that needy are.
14Both from deceit and violence
their soul he shall set free;
And in his sight right precious
and dear their blood shall be.
15Yea, he shall live, and giv'n to him
shall be of Sheba's gold:
For him still shall they pray, and he
shall daily be extoll'd.
16Of corn an handful in the earth
on tops of mountains high,
With prosp'rous fruit shall shake, like trees
on Lebanon that be.
The city shall be flourishing,
her citizens abound
In number shall, like to the grass
that grows upon the ground.
17His name for ever shall endure;
last like the sun it shall:
Men shall be bless'd in him,
and bless'd all nations shall him call.
18Now blessed be the Lord our God,
the God of Israel,
For he alone doth wondrous works,
in glory that excel.
19And blessed be his glorious name
to all eternity:
The whole earth let his glory fill.
Amen, so let it be.
#The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

PSALM 73
Book 3
Psalms 73â€”89
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
A Psalm of Asaph.
1Yet God is good to Israel,
to each pure-hearted one.
2But as for me, my steps near slipp'd,
my feet were almost gone.
3For I envious was, and grudg'd
the foolish folk to see,
When I perceiv'd the wicked sort
enjoy prosperity.
4For still their strength continueth firm;
their death of bands is free.
5They are not toil'd like other men,
nor plagu'd, as others be.
6Therefore their pride, like to a chain,
them compasseth about;
And, as a garment, violence
doth cover them throughout.
7Their eyes stand out with fat; they have
more than their hearts could wish.
8They are corrupt; their talk of wrong
both lewd and lofty is.
9They set their mouth against the heav'ns
in their blasphemous talk;
And their reproaching tongue throughout
the earth at large doth walk.
10His people oftentimes for this
look back, and turn about;
Sith waters of so full a cup
to these are poured out.
11And thus they say, How can it be
that God these things doth know?
Or, Can there in the Highest be
knowledge of things below?
12Behold, these are the wicked ones,
yet prosper at their will
In worldly things; they do increase
in wealth and riches still.
13I verily have done in vain
my heart to purify;
To no effect in innocence
washed my hands have I.
14For daily, and all day throughout,
great plagues I suffer'd have;
Yea, ev'ry morning I of new
did chastisement receive.
15If in this manner foolishly
to speak I would intend,
Thy children's generation,
behold, I should offend.
16When I this thought to know, it was
too hard a thing for me;
17Till to God's sanctuary I went,
then I their end did see.
18Assuredly thou didst them set
a slipp'ry place upon;
Them suddenly thou castedst down
into destruction.
19How in a moment suddenly
to ruin brought are they!
With fearful terrors utterly
they are consum'd away.
20Ev'n like unto a dream, when one
from sleeping doth arise;
So thou, O Lord, when thou awak'st,
their image shalt despise.
21Thus grieved was my heart in me,
and me my reins opprest:
22So rude was I, and ignorant,
and in thy sight a beast.
23Nevertheless continually,
O Lord, I am with thee:
Thou dost me hold by my right hand,
and still upholdest me.
24Thou, with thy counsel, while I live,
wilt me conduct and guide;
And to thy glory afterward
receive me to abide.
25Whom have I in the heavens high
but thee, O Lord, alone?
And in the earth whom I desire
besides thee there is none.
26My flesh and heart doth faint and fail,
but God doth fail me never:
For of my heart God is the strength
and portion for ever.
27For, lo, they that are far from thee
for ever perish shall;
Them that a whoring from thee go
thou hast destroyed all.
28But surely it is good for me
that I draw near to God:
In God I trust, that all thy works
I may declare abroad.

PSALM 74
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
Maschil of Asaph.
1O God, why hast thou cast us off?
is it for evermore?
Against thy pasture-sheep why doth
thine anger smoke so sore?
2O call to thy rememberance
thy congregation,
Which thou hast purchased of old;
still think the same upon:
The rod of thine inheritance,
which thou redeemed hast,
This Sion hill, wherein thou hadst
thy dwelling in times past.
3To these long desolations
thy feet lift, do not tarry;
For all the ills thy foes have done
within thy sanctuary.
4Amidst thy congregations
thine enemies do roar:
Their ensigns they set up for signs
of triumph thee before.
5A man was famous, and was had
in estimation,
According as he lifted up
his axe thick trees upon.
6But all at once with axes now
and hammers they go to,
And down the carved work thereof
they break, and quite undo.
7They fired have thy sanctuary,
and have defil'd the same,
By casting down unto the ground
the place where dwelt thy name.
8Thus said they in their hearts, Let us
destroy them out of hand:
They burnt up all the synagogues
of God within the land.
9Our signs we do not now behold;
there is not us among
A prophet more, nor any one
that knows the time how long.
10How long, Lord, shall the enemy
thus in reproach exclaim?
And shall the adversary thus
always blaspheme thy name?
11Thy hand, ev'n thy right hand of might,
why dost thou thus draw back?
O from thy bosom pluck it out
for our deliv'rance sake.
12For certainly God is my King,
ev'n from the times of old,
Working in midst of all the earth
salvation manifold.
13The sea, by thy great pow'r, to part
asunder thou didst make;
And thou the dragons' heads, O Lord,
within the waters brake.
14The leviathan's head thou brak'st
in pieces, and didst give
Him to be meat unto the folk
in wilderness that live.
15Thou clav'st the fountain and the flood,
which did with streams abound:
Thou dry'dst the mighty waters up
unto the very ground.
16Thine only is the day, O Lord,
thine also is the night;
And thou alone prepared hast
the sun and shining light.
17By thee the borders of the earth
were settled ev'ry where:
The summer and the winter both
by thee created were.
18That th' enemy reproached hath,
O keep it in record;
And that the foolish people have
blasphem'd thy name, O Lord.
19Unto the multitude do not
thy turtle's soul deliver:
The congregation of thy poor
do not forget for ever.
20Unto thy cov'nant have respect;
for earth's dark places be
Full of the habitations
of horrid cruelty.
21O let not those that be oppress'd
return again with shame:
Let those that poor and needy are
give praise unto thy name.
22Do thou, O God, arise and plead
the cause that is thine own:
Remember how thou art reproach'd
still by the foolish one.
23Do not forget the voice of those
that are thine enemies:
Of those the tumult ever grows
that do against thee rise.

PSALM 75
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician, Al-taschith,
A Psalm or Song of Asaph.
1To thee, O God, do we give thanks,
we do give thanks to thee;
Because thy wondrous works declare
thy great name near to be.
2I purpose, when I shall receive
the congregation,
That I shall judgment uprightly
render to ev'ry one.
3Dissolved is the land, with all
that in the same do dwell;
But I the pillars thereof do
Bear up, and stablish well.
4I to the foolish people said,
Do not deal foolishly;
And unto those that wicked are,
Lift not your horn on high.
5Lift not your horn on high, nor speak
6with stubborn neck. But know,
That not from east, nor west, nor south,
promotion doth flow.
7But God is judge; he puts down one,
and sets another up.
8For in the hand of God most high
of red wine is a cup:
'Tis full of mixture, he pours forth,
and makes the wicked all
Wring out the bitter dregs thereof; yea,
and they drink them shall.
9But I for ever will declare,
I Jacob's God will praise.
10All horns of lewd men I'll cut off;
but just men's horns will raise.

PSALM 76
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician on Neginoth,
A Psalm or Song of Asaph.
1In Judah's land God is well known,
his name's in Isr'el great:
2In Salem is his tabernacle,
in Sion is his seat.
3There arrows of the bow he brake,
the shield, the sword, the war.
4More glorious thou than hills of prey,
more excellent art far.
5Those that were stout of heart are spoil'd,
they slept their sleep outright;
And none of those their hands did find,
that were the men of might.
6When thy rebuke, O Jacob's God,
had forth against them past,
Their horses and their chariots both
were in a dead sleep cast.
7Thou, Lord, ev'n thou art he that should
be fear'd; and who is he
That may stand up before thy sight,
if once thou angry be?
8From heav'n thou judgment caus'd be heard;
the earth was still with fear,
9When God to judgment rose, to save
all meek on earth that were.
10Surely the very wrath of man
unto thy praise redounds:
Thou to the remnant of his wrath
wilt set restraining bounds.
11Vow to the Lord your God,
and pay: all ye that near him be,
Bring gifts and presents unto him;
for to be fear'd is he.
12By him the sp'rits shall be cut off
of those that princes are:
Unto the kings that are on earth
he fearful doth appear.

PSALM 77
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun,
A Psalm of Asaph.
1Unto the Lord I with my voice,
I unto God did cry;
Ev'n with my voice,
and unto me his ear he did apply.
2I in my trouble sought the Lord,
my sore by night did run,
And ceased not; my grieved soul
did consolation shun.
3I to remembrance God did call,
yet trouble did remain;
And overwhelm'd my spirit was,
whilst I did sore complain.
4Mine eyes, debarr'd from rest and sleep,
thou makest still to wake;
My trouble is so great that I
unable am to speak.
5The days of old to mind I call'd,
and oft did think upon
The times and ages that are past
full many years agone.
6By night my song I call to mind,
and commune with my heart;
My sp'rit did carefully enquire
how I might ease my smart.
7For ever will the Lord cast off,
and gracious be no more?
8For ever is his mercy gone?
fails his word evermore?
9Is't true that to be gracious
the Lord forgotten hath?
And that his tender mercies he
hath shut up in his wrath?
10Then did I say, That surely this
is mine infirmity:
I'll mind the years of the right hand
of him that is most High.
11Yea, I remember will the works
performed by the Lord:
The wonders done of old by thee
I surely will record.
12I also will of all thy works
my meditation make;
And of thy doings to discourse
great pleasure I will take.
13O God, thy way most holy is
within thy sanctuary;
And what god is so great in pow'r
as is our God most high?
14Thou art the God that wonders do'st
by thy right hand most strong:
Thy mighty pow'r thou hast declar'd
the nations among.
15To thine own people with thine arm
thou didst redemption bring;
To Jacob's sons,
and to the tribes of Joseph that do spring.
16The waters, Lord, perceived thee,
the waters saw thee well;
And they for fear aside did flee;
the depths on trembling fell.
17The clouds in water forth were pour'd,
sound loudly did the sky;
And swiftly through the world abroad
thine arrows fierce did fly.
18Thy thunder's voice alongst the heav'n
a mighty noise did make;
By lightnings lighten'd was the world,
th' earth tremble did and shake.
19Thy way is in the sea, and in
the waters great thy path;
Yet are thy footsteps hid, O Lord;
none knowledge thereof hath.
20Thy people thou didst safely lead,
like to a flock of sheep;
By Moses' hand and Aaron's thou
didst them conduct and keep.

PSALM 78
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
Maschil of Asaph.
1Attend, my people, to my law;
thereto give thou an ear;
The words that from my mouth proceed
attentively do hear.
2My mouth shall speak a parable,
and sayings dark of old;
3The same which we have heard and known,
and us our fathers told.
4We also will them not conceal
from their posterity;
Them to the generation
to come declare will we:
The praises of the Lord our God,
and his almighty strength,
The wondrous works that he hath done,
we will shew forth at length.
5His testimony and his law
in Isr'el he did place,
And charg'd our fathers it to show
to their succeeding race;
6That so the race which was to come
might well them learn and know;
And sons unborn, who should arise,
might to their sons them show:
7That they might set their hope in God,
and suffer not to fall
His mighty works out of their mind,
but keep his precepts all:
8And might not, like their fathers, be
a stiff rebellious race;
A race not right in heart; with God
whose sp'rit not stedfast was.
9The sons of Ephraim, who nor bows
nor other arms did lack,
When as the day of battle was,
they faintly turned back.
10They brake God's cov'nant,
and refus'd in his commands to go;
11His works and wonders they forgot,
which he to them did show.
12Things marvellous he brought to pass;
their fathers them beheld
Within the land of Egypt done,
yea, ev'n in Zoan's field.
13By him divided was the sea,
he caus'd them through to pass;
And made the waters so to stand,
as like an heap it was.
14With cloud by day, with light of fire
all night, he did them guide.
15In desert rocks he clave,
and drink, as from great depths, supply'd.
16He from the rock brought streams, like floods
made waters to run down.
17Yet sinning more, in desert they
provok'd the Highest One.
18For in their heart they tempted God,
and, speaking with mistrust,
They greedily did meat require
to satisfy their lust.
19Against the Lord himself they spake,
and, murmuring, said thus,
A table in the wilderness
can God prepare for us?
20Behold, he smote the rock, and thence
came streams and waters great;
But can he give his people bread?
and send them flesh to eat?
21The Lord did hear, and waxed wroth;
so kindled was a flame
'Gainst Jacob, and 'gainst Israel
up indignation came.
22For they believ'd not God, nor trust
in his salvation had;
23Though clouds above he did command,
and heav'n's doors open made,
24And manna rain'd on them,
and gave them corn of heav'n to eat.
25Man angels' food did eat; to them
he to the full sent meat.
26And in the heaven he did cause
an eastern wind to blow;
And by his power he let out
the southern wind to go.
27Then flesh as thick as dust he made
to rain down them among;
And feather'd fowls, like as the sand
which li'th the shore along.
28At his command amidst their camp
these show'rs of flesh down fell,
All round about the tabernacles
and tents where they did dwell.
29So they did eat abundantly,
and had of meat their fill;
For he did give to them what was
their own desire and will.
30They from their lust had not estrang'd
their heart and their desire;
But while the meat was in their mouths,
which they did so require,
31God's wrath upon them came,
and slew the fattest of them all;
So that the choice of Israel,
o'erthrown by death, did fall.
32Yet, notwithstanding of all this,
they sinned still the more;
And though he had great wonders wrought,
believ'd him not therefore:
33Wherefore their days in vanity
he did consume and waste;
And by his wrath their wretched years
away in trouble past.
34But when he slew them, then they did
to seek him shew desire;
Yea, they return'd, and after God
right early did enquire.
35And that the Lord had been their Rock,
they did remember then;
Ev'n that the high almighty God
had their Redeemer been.
36Yet with their mouth they flatter'd him,
and spake but feignedly;
And they unto the God of truth
with their false tongues did lie.
37For though their words were good, their heart
with him was not sincere;
Unstedfast and perfidious
they in his cov'nant were.
38But, full of pity, he forgave
their sin, them did not slay;
Nor stirr'd up all his wrath, but oft
his anger turn'd away.
39For that they were but fading flesh
to mind he did recall;
A wind that passeth soon away,
and not returns at all.
40How often did they him provoke
within the wilderness!
And in the desert did him grieve
with their rebelliousness!
41Yea, turning back, they tempted God,
and limits set upon
Him, who in midst of Isr'el is
the only Holy One.
42They did not call to mind his pow'r,
nor yet the day when he
Deliver'd them out of the hand
of their fierce enemy;
43Nor how great signs in Egypt land
he openly had wrought;
What miracles in Zoan's field
his hand to pass had brought.
44How lakes and rivers ev'ry where
he turned into blood;
So that nor man nor beast could drink
of standing lake or flood.
45He brought among them swarms of flies,
which did them sore annoy;
And divers kinds of filthy frogs
he sent them to destroy.
46He to the caterpillar gave
the fruits of all their soil;
Their labours he deliver'd up
unto the locusts' spoil.
47Their vines with hail, their sycamores
he with the frost did blast:
48Their beasts to hail he gave; their flocks
hot thunderbolts did waste.
49Fierce burning wrath he on them cast,
and indignation strong,
And troubles sore, by sending forth
ill angels them among.
50He to his wrath made way; their soul
from death he did not save;
But over to the pestilence
the lives of them he gave.
51In Egypt land the first-born all
he smote down ev'ry where;
Among the tents of Ham, ev'n these
chief of their strength that were.
52But his own people, like to sheep,
thence to go forth he made;
And he, amidst the wilderness,
them, as a flock, did lead.
53And he them safely on did lead,
so that they did not fear;
Whereas their en'mies by the sea
quite overwhelmed were.
54To borders of his sanctuary
the Lord his people led,
Ev'n to the mount which his right hand
for them had purchased.
55The nations of Canaan,
by his almighty hand,
Before their face he did expel
out of their native land;
Which for inheritance to them
by line he did divide,
And made the tribes of Israel
within their tents abide.
56Yet God most high they did provoke,
and tempted ever still;
And to observe his testimonies
did not incline their will:
57But, like their fathers, turned back,
and dealt unfaithfully:
Aside they turned, like a bow
that shoots deceitfully.
58For they to anger did provoke
him with their places high;
And with their graven images
mov'd him to jealousy.
59When God heard this, he waxed wroth,
and much loath'd Isr'el then:
60So Shiloh's tent he left, the tent
which he had plac'd with men.
61And he his strength delivered
into captivity;
He left his glory in the hand
of his proud enemy.
62His people also he gave o'er
unto the sword's fierce rage:
So sore his wrath inflamed was
against his heritage.
63The fire consum'd their choice young men;
their maids no marriage had;
64And when their priests fell by the sword,
their wives no mourning made.
65But then the Lord arose, as one
that doth from sleep awake;
And like a giant that, by wine
refresh'd, a shout doth make:
66Upon his en'mies' hinder parts
he made his stroke to fall;
And so upon them he did put
a shame perpetual.
67Moreover, he the tabernacle
of Joseph did refuse;
The mighty tribe of Ephraim
he would in no wise chuse:
68But he did chuse Jehudah's tribe
to be the rest above;
And of mount Sion he made choice,
which he so much did love.
69And he his sanctuary built
like to a palace high,
Like to the earth which he did found
to perpetuity.
70Of David, that his servant was,
he also choice did make,
And even from the folds of sheep
was pleased him to take:
71From waiting on the ewes with young,
he brought him forth to feed
Israel, his inheritance,
his people, Jacob's seed.
72So after the integrity
he of his heart them fed;
And by the good skill of his hands
them wisely governed.

PSALM 79
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
A Psalm of Asaph.
1O God, the heathen enter'd have
thine heritage; by them
Defiled is thy house: on heaps
they laid Jerusalem.
2The bodies of thy servants they
have cast forth to be meat
To rav'nous fowls; thy dear saints' flesh
they gave to beasts to eat.
3Their blood about Jerusalem
like water they have shed;
And there was none to bury them
when they were slain and dead.
4Unto our neighbours a reproach
most base become are we;
A scorn and laughingstock to them
that round about us be.
5How long, Lord, shall thine anger last?
wilt thou still keep the same?
And shall thy fervent jealousy
burn like unto a flame?
6On heathen pour thy fury forth,
that have thee never known,
And on those kingdoms which thy name
have never call'd upon.
7For these are they who Jacob have
devoured cruelly;
And they his habitation
have caused waste to lie.
8Against us mind not former sins;
thy tender mercies show;
Let them prevent us speedily,
for we're brought very low.
9For thy name's glory help us, Lord,
who hast our Saviour been:
Deliver us; for thy name's sake,
O purge away our sin.
10Why say the heathen, Where's their God?
let him to them be known;
When those who shed thy servants' blood
are in our sight o'erthrown.
11O let the pris'ner's sighs ascend
before thy sight on high;
Preserve those in thy mighty pow'r
that are design'd to die.
12And to our neighbours' bosom cause
it sev'n-fold render'd be,
Ev'n the reproach wherewith they have,
O Lord, reproached thee.
13So we thy folk, and pasture-sheep,
shall give thee thanks always;
And unto generations all
we will shew forth thy praise.

PSALM 80
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief musician upon Shoshannim, Eduth,
A Psalm of Asaph.
1Hear, Isr'el's Shepherd! like a flock
thou that dost Joseph guide;
Shine forth, O thou that dost between
the cherubims abide.
2In Ephraim's, and Benjamin's
and in Manasseh's sight,
O come for our salvation;
stir up thy strength and might.
3Turn us again, O Lord our God,
and upon us vouchsafe
To make thy countenance to shine,
and so we shall be safe.
4O Lord of hosts, almighty God,
how long shall kindled be
Thy wrath against the prayer made
by thine own folk to thee?
5Thou tears of sorrow giv'st to them
instead of bread to eat;
Yea, tears instead of drink thou giv'st
to them in measure great.
6Thou makest us a strife unto
our neighbours round about;
Our enemies among themselves
at us do laugh and flout.
7Turn us again, O God of hosts,
and upon us vouchsafe
To make thy countenance to shine,
and so we shall be safe.
8A vine from Egypt brought thou hast,
by thine outstretched hand;
And thou the heathen out didst cast,
to plant it in their land.
9Before it thou a room didst make,
where it might grow and stand;
Thou causedst it deep root to take,
and it did fill the land.
10The mountains vail'd were with its shade,
as with a covering;
Like goodly cedars were the boughs
which out from it did spring.
11Upon the one hand to the sea
her boughs she did out send;
On th' other side unto the flood
her branches did extend.
12Why hast thou then thus broken down,
and ta'en her hedge away?
So that all passengers do pluck,
and make of her a prey.
13The boar who from the forest comes
doth waste it at his pleasure;
The wild beast of the field also
devours it out of measure.
14O God of hosts, we thee beseech,
return now unto thine;
Look down from heav'n in love, behold,
and visit this thy vine:
15This vineyard, which thine own right hand
hath planted us among;
And that same branch, which for thyself
thou hast made to be strong.
16Burnt up it is with flaming fire,
it also is cut down:
They utterly are perished,
when as thy face doth frown.
17O let thy hand be still upon
the Man of thy right hand,
The Son of man, whom for thyself
thou madest strong to stand.
18So henceforth we will not go back,
nor turn from thee at all:
O do thou quicken us,
and we upon thy name will call.
19Turn us again, Lord God of hosts,
and upon us vouchsafe
To make thy countenance to shine,
and so we shall be safe.

PSALM 81
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician upon Gittith,
A Psalm of Asaph.
1Sing loud to God our strength; with joy
to Jacob's God do sing.
2Take up a psalm, the pleasant harp,
timbrel and psalt'ry bring.
3Blow trumpets at new-moon, what day
our feast appointed is:
4For charge to Isr'el,
and a law of Jacob's God was this.
5To Joseph this a testimony
he made, when Egypt land
He travell'd through, where speech I heard
I did not understand.
6His shoulder I from burdens took,
his hands from pots did free.
7Thou didst in trouble on me call,
and I deliver'd thee:
In secret place of thundering
I did thee answer make;
And at the streams of Meribah
of thee a proof did take.
8O thou, my people, give an ear,
I'll testify to thee;
To thee, O Isr'el, if thou wilt
but hearken unto me.
9In midst of thee there shall not be
any strange god at all;
Nor unto any god unknown
thou bowing down shalt fall.
10I am the Lord thy God, which did
from Egypt land thee guide;
I'll fill thy mouth abundantly,
do thou it open wide.
11But yet my people to my voice
would not attentive be;
And ev'n my chosen Israel
he would have none of me.
12So to the lust of their own hearts
I them delivered;
And then in counsels of their own
they vainly wandered.
13O that my people had me heard,
Isr'el my ways had chose!
14I had their en'mies soon subdu'd,
my hand turn'd on their foes.
15The haters of the Lord to him
submission should have feign'd;
But as for them, their time should have
for evermore remain'd.
16He should have also fed them with
the finest of the wheat;
Of honey from the rock thy fill
I should have made thee eat.

PSALM 82
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
A Psalm of Asaph.
1In gods' assembly God doth stand;
he judgeth gods among.
2How long, accepting persons vile,
will ye give judgment wrong?
3Defend the poor and fatherless;
to poor oppress'd do right.
4The poor and needy ones set free;
rid them from ill men's might.
5They know not, nor will understand;
in darkness they walk on:
All the foundations of the earth
out of their course are gone.
6I said that ye are gods, and are
sons of the Highest all:
7But ye shall die like men, and as
one of the princes fall.
8O God, do thou raise up thyself,
the earth to judgment call:
For thou, as thine inheritance,
shalt take the nations all.

PSALM 83
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
Song or Psalm of Asaph.
1Keep not, O God, we thee entreat,
O keep not silence now:
Do thou not hold thy peace, O God,
and still no more be thou.
2For, lo, thine enemies a noise
tumultuously have made;
And they that haters are of thee
have lifted up the head.
3Against thy chosen people they
do crafty counsel take;
And they against thy hidden ones
do consultations make.
4Come, let us cut them off, said they,
from being a nation,
That of the name of Isr'el may
no more be mention.
5For with joint heart they plot, in league
against thee they combine.
6The tents of Edom, Ishm'elites,
Moab's and Hagar's line;
7Gebal, and Ammon, Amalek,
Philistines, those of Tyre;
8And Assur join'd with them, to help
Lot's children they conspire.
9Do to them as to Midian,
Jabin at Kison strand;
10And Sis'ra, which at En-dor fell,
as dung to fat the land.
11Like Oreb and like Zeeb make
their noble men to fall;
Like Zeba and Zalmunna like,
make thou their princes all;
12Who said, For our possession
let us God's houses take.
13My God, them like a wheel, as chaff
before the wind, them make.
14As fire consumes the wood, as flame
doth mountains set on fire,
15Chase and affright them with the storm
and tempest of thine ire.
16Their faces fill with shame, O Lord,
that they may seek thy name.
17Let them confounded be, and vex'd,
and perish in their shame:
18That men may know that thou, to whom
alone doth appertain
The name JEHOVAH, dost most high
o'er all the earth remain.

PSALM 84
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician upon Gittith,
A Psalm for the sons of Korah.
1How lovely is thy dwelling-place,
O Lord of hosts, to me!
The tabernacles of thy grace
how pleasant, Lord, they be!
2My thirsty soul longs veh'mently,
yea faints, thy courts to see:
My very heart and flesh cry out,
O living God, for thee.
3Behold, the sparrow findeth out
an house wherein to rest;
The swallow also for herself
hath purchased a nest;
Ev'n thine own altars, where she safe
her young ones forth may bring,
O thou almighty Lord of hosts,
who art my God and King.
4Bless'd are they in thy house that dwell,
they ever give thee praise.
5Bless'd is the man whose strength thou art,
in whose heart are thy ways:
6Who passing thorough Baca's vale,
therein do dig up wells;
Also the rain that falleth down
the pools with water fills.
7So they from strength unwearied go
still forward unto strength,
Until in Sion they appear
before the Lord at length.
8Lord God of hosts, my prayer hear;
O Jacob's God, give ear.
9See God our shield, look on the face
of thine anointed dear.
10For in thy courts one day excels
a thousand; rather in
My God's house will I keep a door,
than dwell in tents of sin.
11For God the Lord's a sun and shield:
he'll grace and glory give;
And will withhold no good from them
that uprightly do live.
12O thou that art the Lord of hosts,
that man is truly blest,
Who by assured confidence
on thee alone doth rest.

PSALM 85
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician,
A Psalm for the sons of Korah.
1O Lord, thou hast been favourable
to thy beloved land:
Jacob's captivity thou hast
recall'd with mighty hand.
2Thou pardoned thy people hast
all their iniquities;
Thou all their trespasses and sins
hast cover'd from thine eyes.
3Thou took'st off all thine ire, and turn'dst
from thy wrath's furiousness.
4Turn us, God of our health, and cause
thy wrath 'gainst us to cease.
5Shall thy displeasure thus endure
against us without end?
Wilt thou to generations all
thine anger forth extend?
6That in thee may thy people joy,
wilt thou not us revive?
7Shew us thy mercy, Lord, to us
do thy salvation give.
8I'll hear what God the Lord will speak:
to his folk he'll speak peace,
And to his saints; but let them not
return to foolishness.
9To them that fear him surely near
is his salvation;
That glory in our land may have
her habitation.
10Truth met with mercy, righteousness
and peace kiss'd mutually:
11Truth springs from earth, and righteousness
looks down from heaven high.
12Yea, what is good the Lord shall give;
our land shall yield increase:
13Justice, to set us in his steps,
shall go before his face.

PSALM 86

A Prayer of David.
1O Lord, do thou bow down thine ear,
and hear me graciously;
Because I sore afflicted am,
and am in poverty.
2Because I'm holy, let my soul
by thee preserved be:
O thou my God, thy servant save,
that puts his trust in thee.
3Sith unto thee I daily cry,
be merciful to me.
4Rejoice thy servant's soul; for, Lord,
I lift my soul to thee.
5For thou art gracious, O Lord,
and ready to forgive;
And rich in mercy, all that call
upon thee to relieve.
6Hear, Lord, my pray'r; unto the voice
of my request attend:
7In troublous times I'll call on thee;
for thou wilt answer send.
8Lord, there is none among the gods
that may with thee compare;
And like the works which thou hast done,
not any work is there.
9All nations whom thou mad'st shall come
and worship rev'rently
Before thy face; and they, O Lord,
thy name shall glorify.
10Because thou art exceeding great,
and works by thee are done
Which are to be admir'd; and thou
art God thyself alone.
11Teach me thy way, and in thy truth,
O Lord, then walk will I;
Unite my heart, that I thy name
may fear continually.
12O Lord my God, with all my heart
to thee I will give praise;
And I the glory will ascribe
unto thy name always:
13Because thy mercy toward me
in greatness doth excel;
And thou deliver'd hast my soul
out from the lowest hell.
14O God, the proud against me rise,
and vi'lent men have met,
That for my soul have sought; and thee
before them have not set.
15But thou art full of pity, Lord,
a God most gracious,
Long-suffering, and in thy truth
and mercy plenteous.
16O turn to me thy countenance,
and mercy on me have;
Thy servant strengthen, and the son
of thine own handmaid save.
17Shew me a sign for good, that they
which do me hate may see,
And be asham'd; because thou, Lord,
didst help and comfort me.

PSALM 87

2God, more than Jacob's dwellings all,

3Things glorious are said of thee,
thou city of the Lord.
4Rahab and Babel I, to those
that know me, will record:
Behold ev'n Tyrus, and with it
the land of Palestine,
And likewise Ethiopia;
this man was born therein.
5And it of Sion shall be said,
This man and that man there
Was born; and he that is most High
himself shall stablish her.

that this man born was there.
7There be that sing and play; and all
my well-springs in thee are.

PSALM 88

A Song or Psalm for the sons of Korah, to the chief Musician upon Mahalath Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.
1Lord God, my Saviour, day and night
before thee cry'd have I.
2Before thee let my prayer come;
give ear unto my cry.
3For troubles great do fill my soul;
my life draws nigh the grave.
4I'm counted with those that go down to pit,
and no strength have.
5Ev'n free among the dead, like them
that slain in grave do lie;
Cut off from thy hand, whom no more
thou hast in memory.
6Thou hast me laid in lowest pit,
in deeps and darksome caves.
7Thy wrath lies hard on me, thou hast
me press'd with all thy waves.
8Thou hast put far from me my friends,
thou mad'st them to abhor me;
And I am so shut up, that I
find no evasion for me.
9By reason of affliction
mine eye mourns dolefully:
To thee, Lord, do I call,
and stretch my hands continually.
10Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead?
shall they rise, and thee bless?
11Shall in the grave thy love be told?
in death thy faithfulness?
12Shall thy great wonders in the dark,
or shall thy righteousness
Be known to any in the land
of deep forgetfulness?
13But, Lord, to thee I cry'd; my pray'r
at morn prevent shall thee.
14Why, Lord, dost thou cast off my soul,
and hid'st thy face from me?
15Distress'd am I, and from my youth
I ready am to die;
Thy terrors I have borne, and am
distracted fearfully.
16The dreadful fierceness of thy wrath
quite over me doth go:
Thy terrors great have cut me off,
they did pursue me so.
17For round about me ev'ry day,
like water, they did roll;
And, gathering together, they
have compassed my soul.
18My friends thou hast put far from me,
and him that did me love;
And those that mine acquaintance were
to darkness didst remove.

PSALM 89
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite.
1God's mercies I will ever sing;
and with my mouth I shall
Thy faithfulness make to be known
to generations all.
2For mercy shall be built, said I,
for ever to endure;
Thy faithfulness, ev'n in the heav'ns,
thou wilt establish sure.
3I with my chosen One have made
a cov'nant graciously;
And to my servant, whom I lov'd,
to David sworn have I;
4That I thy seed establish shall
for ever to remain,
And will to generations all
thy throne build and maintain.
5The praises of thy wonders, Lord,
the heavens shall express;
And in the congregation
of saints thy faithfulness.
6For who in heaven with the Lord
may once himself compare?
Who is like God among the sons
of those that mighty are?
7Great fear in meeting of the saints
is due unto the Lord;
And he of all about him should
with rev'rence be ador'd.
8O thou that art the Lord of hosts,
what Lord in mightiness
Is like to thee? who compass'd round
art with thy faithfulness.
9Ev'n in the raging of the sea
thou over it dost reign;
And when the waves thereof do swell,
thou stillest them again.
10Rahab in pieces thou didst break,
like one that slaughter'd is;
And with thy mighty arm thou hast
dispers'd thine enemies.
11The heav'ns are thine, thou for thine own
the earth dost also take;
The world, and fulness of the same,
thy pow'r did found and make.
12The north and south from thee alone
their first beginning had;
Both Tabor mount and Hermon hill
shall in thy name be glad.
13Thou hast an arm that's full of pow'r,
thy hand is great in might;
And thy right hand exceedingly
exalted is in height.
14Justice and judgment of thy throne
are made the dwelling-place;
Mercy, accompany'd with truth,
shall go before thy face.
15O greatly bless'd the people are
the joyful sound that know;
In brightness of thy face, O Lord,
they ever on shall go.
16They in thy name shall all the day
rejoice exceedingly;
And in thy righteousness shall they
exalted be on high.
17Because the glory of their strength
doth only stand in thee;
And in thy favour shall our horn
and pow'r exalted be.
18For God is our defence; and he
to us doth safety bring:
The Holy One of Israel
is our almighty King.
19In vision to thy Holy One
thou saidst, I help upon
A strong one laid; out of the folk
I rais'd a chosen one;
20Ev'n David, I have found him out
a servant unto me;
And with my holy oil my King
anointed him to be.
21With whom my hand shall stablish'd be;
mine arm shall make him strong.
22On him the foe shall not exact,
nor son of mischief wrong.
23I will beat down before his face
all his malicious foes;
I will them greatly plague who do
with hatred him oppose.
24My mercy and my faithfulness
with him yet still shall be;
And in my name his horn and pow'r
men shall exalted see.
25His hand and pow'r shall reach afar;
I'll set it in the sea;
And his right hand established
shall in the rivers be.
26Thou art my Father, he shall cry,
thou art my God alone;
And he shall say, Thou art the Rock
of my salvation.
27I'll make him my first-born, more high
than kings of any land.
28My love I'll ever keep for him,
my cov'nant fast shall stand.
29His seed I by my pow'r will make
for ever to endure;
And, as the days of heav'n, his throne
shall stable be, and sure.
30But if his children shall forsake
my laws, and go astray,
And in my judgments shall not walk,
but wander from my way:
31If they my laws break,
and do not keep my commandements;
32I'll visit then their faults with rods,
their sins with chastisements.
33Yet I'll not take my love from him,
nor false my promise make.
34My cov'nant I'll not break, nor change
what with my mouth I spake.
35Once by my holiness I sware,
to David I'll not lie;
36His seed and throne shall, as the sun,
before me last for aye.
37It, like the moon, shall ever be
establish'd stedfastly;
And like to that which in the heav'n
doth witness faithfully.
38But thou, displeased, hast cast off,
thou didst abhor and loathe;
With him that thine anointed is
thou hast been very wroth.
39Thou hast thy servant's covenant
made void, and quite cast by;
Thou hast profan'd his crown, while it
cast on the ground doth lie.
40Thou all his hedges hast broke down,
his strong holds down hast torn.
41He to all passers-by a spoil,
to neighbours is a scorn.
42Thou hast set up his foes' right hand;
mad'st all his en'mies glad:
43Turn'd his sword's edge, and him
to stand in battle hast not made.
44His glory thou hast made to cease,
his throne to ground down cast;
45Shorten'd his days of youth, and him
with shame thou cover'd hast.
46How long, Lord, wilt thou hide thyself?
for ever, in thine ire?
And shall thine indignation
burn like unto a fire?
47Remember, Lord, how short a time
I shall on earth remain:
O wherefore is it so that thou
has made all men in vain?
48What man is he that liveth here,
and death shall never see?
Or from the power of the grave
what man his soul shall free?
49Thy former loving-kindnesses,
O Lord, where be they now?
Those which in truth and faithfulness
to David sworn hast thou?
50Mind, Lord, thy servant's sad reproach;
how I in bosom bear
The scornings of the people all,
who strong and mighty are.
51Wherewith thy raging enemies
reproach'd, O Lord, think on;
Wherewith they have reproach'd the steps
of thine anointed one.
52All blessing to the Lord our God
let be ascribed then:
For evermore so let it be.
Amen, yea, and amen.

1Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place
in generations all.
2Before thou ever hadst brought forth
the mountains great or small;
Ere ever thou hadst form'd the earth,
and all the world abroad;
Ev'n thou from everlasting art
to everlasting God.
3Thou dost unto destruction
man that is mortal turn;
And unto them thou say'st, Again,
ye sons of men, return.
4Because a thousand years appear
no more before thy sight
Than yesterday, when it is past,
or than a watch by night.
5As with an overflowing flood
thou carry'st them away:
They like a sleep are, like the grass
that grows at morn are they.
6At morn it flourishes and grows,
cut down at ev'n doth fade.
7For by thine anger we're consum'd,
thy wrath makes us afraid.
8Our sins thou and iniquities
dost in thy presence place,
And sett'st our secret faults before
the brightness of thy face.
9For in thine anger all our days
do pass on to an end;
And as a tale that hath been told,
so we our years do spend.
10Threescore and ten years do sum up
our days and years, we see;
Or, if, by reason of more strength,
in some fourscore they be:
Yet doth the strength of such old men
but grief and labour prove;
For it is soon cut off,
and we fly hence, and soon remove.
11Who knows the power of thy wrath?
according to thy fear
12So is thy wrath: Lord, teach thou us
our end in mind to bear;
And so to count our days, that we
our hearts may still apply
To learn thy wisdom and thy truth,
that we may live thereby.
13Turn yet again to us, O Lord,
how long thus shall it be?
Let it repent thee now for those
that servants are to thee.
14O with thy tender mercies, Lord,
us early satisfy;
So we rejoice shall all our days,
and still be glad in thee.
15According as the days have been,
wherein we grief have had,
And years wherein we ill have seen,
so do thou make us glad.
16O let thy work and pow'r appear
thy servants' face before;
And shew unto their children dear
thy glory evermore:
17And let the beauty of the Lord
our God be us upon:
Our handy-works establish thou,
establish them each one.

PSALM 91
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1He that doth in the secret place
of the most High reside,
Under the shade of him that is
th' Almighty shall abide.
2I of the Lord my God will say,
He is my refuge still,
He is my fortress, and my God,
and in him trust I will.
3Assuredly he shall thee save,
and give deliverance
From subtile fowler's snare,
and from the noisome pestilence.
4His feathers shall thee hide; thy trust
under his wings shall be:
His faithfulness shall be a shield
and buckler unto thee.
5Thou shalt not need to be afraid
for terrors of the night;
Nor for the arrow that doth fly
by day, while it is light;
6Nor for the pestilence, that walks
in darkness secretly;
Nor for destruction, that doth waste
at noon-day openly.
7A thousand at thy side shall fall,
on thy right hand shall lie
Ten thousand dead; yet unto thee
it shall not once come nigh.
8Only thou with thine eyes shalt look,
and a beholder be;
And thou therein the just reward
of wicked men shalt see.
9Because the Lord, who constantly
my refuge is alone,
Ev'n the most High, is made by thee
thy habitation;
10No plague shall near thy dwelling come;
no ill shall thee befall:
11For thee to keep in all thy ways
his angels charge he shall.
12They in their hands shall bear thee up,
still waiting thee upon;
Lest thou at any time should'st dash
thy foot against a stone.
13Upon the adder thou shalt tread,
and on the lion strong;
Thy feet on dragons trample shall,
and on the lions young.
14Because on me he set his love,
I'll save and set him free;
Because my great name he hath known,
I will him set on high.
15He'll call on me, I'll answer him;
I will be with him still
In trouble, to deliver him,
and honour him I will.
16With length of days unto his mind
I will him satisfy;
I also my salvation
will cause his eyes to see.

PSALM 92
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
A Psalm or Song for the sabbath day.
1To render thanks unto the Lord
it is a comely thing,
And to thy name, O thou most High,
due praise aloud to sing.
2Thy loving-kindness to shew forth
when shines the morning light;
And to declare thy faithfulness
with pleasure ev'ry night.
3On a ten-stringed instrument,
upon the psaltery,
And on the harp with solemn sound,
and grave sweet melody.
4For thou, Lord, by thy mighty works
hast made my heart right glad;
And I will triumph in the works
which by thine hands were made.
5How great, Lord, are thy works! each thought
of thine a deep it is:
6A brutish man it knoweth not;
fools understand not this.
7When those that lewd and wicked are
spring quickly up like grass,
And workers of iniquity
do flourish all apace;
It is that they for ever may
destroyed be and slain;
8But thou, O Lord, art the most High,
for ever to remain.
9For, lo, thine enemies, O Lord,
thine en'mies perish shall;
The workers of iniquity
shall be dispersed all.
10But thou shalt, like unto the horn
of th' unicorn, exalt
My horn on high: thou with fresh oil
anoint me also shalt.
11Mine eyes shall also my desire
see on mine enemies;
Mine ears shall of the wicked hear
that do against me rise.
12But like the palm-tree flourishing
shall be the righteous one;
He shall like to the cedar grow
that is in Lebanon.
13Those that within the house of God
are planted by his grace,
They shall grow up, and flourish all
in our God's holy place.
14And in old age, when others fade,
they fruit still forth shall bring;
They shall be fat, and full of sap,
and aye be flourishing;
15To shew that upright is the Lord:
he is a rock to me;
And he from all unrighteousness
is altogether free.

PSALM 93
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1The Lord doth reign, and cloth'd is he
with majesty most bright;
His works do shew him cloth'd to be,
and girt about with might.
The world is also stablished,
that it cannot depart.
2Thy throne is fix'd of old, and thou
from everlasting art.
3The floods, O Lord, have lifted up,
they lifted up their voice;
The floods have lifted up their waves,
and made a mighty noise.
4But yet the Lord, that is on high,
is more of might by far
Than noise of many waters is,
or great sea-billows are.
5Thy testimonies ev'ry one
in faithfulness excel;
And holiness for ever, Lord,
thine house becometh well.

PSALM 94
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1O Lord God, unto whom alone
all vengeance doth belong;
O mighty God, who vengeance own'st,
shine forth, avenging wrong.
2Lift up thyself, thou of the earth
the sov'reign Judge that art;
And unto those that are so proud
a due reward impart.
3How long, O mighty God, shall they
who lewd and wicked be,
How long shall they who wicked are
thus triumph haughtily?
4How long shall things most hard by them
be uttered and told?
And all that work iniquity
to boast themselves be bold?
5Thy folk they break in pieces, Lord,
thine heritage oppress:
6The widow they and stranger slay,
and kill the fatherless.
7Yet say they, God it shall not see,
nor God of Jacob know.
8Ye brutish people! understand;
fools! when wise will ye grow?
9The Lord did plant the ear of man,
and hear then shall not he?
He only form'd the eye, and
then shall he not clearly see?
10He that the nations doth correct,
shall he not chastise you?
He knowledge unto man doth teach,
and shall himself not know?
11Man's thoughts to be but vanity
the Lord doth well discern.
12Bless'd is the man thou chast'nest, Lord,
and mak'st thy law to learn:
13That thou may'st give him rest from days
of sad adversity,
Until the pit be digg'd for those
that work iniquity.
14For sure the Lord will not cast off
those that his people be,
Neither his own inheritance
quit and forsake will he:
15But judgment unto righteousness
shall yet return again;
And all shall follow after it
that are right-hearted men.
16Who will rise up for me against
those that do wickedly?
Who will stand up for me 'gainst those
that work iniquity?
17Unless the Lord had been my help
when I was sore opprest,
Almost my soul had in the house
of silence been at rest.
18When I had uttered this word,
(my foot doth slip away,)
Thy mercy held me up, O Lord,
thy goodness did me stay.
19Amidst the multitude of thoughts
which in my heart do fight,
My soul, lest it be overcharg'd,
thy comforts do delight.
20Shall of iniquity the throne
have fellowship with thee,
Which mischief, cunningly contriv'd,
doth by a law decree?
21Against the righteous souls they join,
they guiltless blood condemn.
22But of my refuge God's the rock,
and my defence from them.
23On them their own iniquity
the Lord shall bring and lay,
And cut them off in their own sin;
our Lord God shall them slay.

PSALM 95
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1O come, let us sing to the Lord:
come, let us ev'ry one
A joyful noise make to the Rock
of our salvation.
2Let us before his presence come
with praise and thankful voice;
Let us sing psalms to him with grace,
and make a joyful noise.
3For God, a great God, and great King,
above all gods he is.
4Depths of the earth are in his hand,
the strength of hills is his.
5To him the spacious sea belongs,
for he the same did make;
The dry land also from his hands
its form at first did take.
6O come, and let us worship him,
let us bow down withal,
And on our knees before the Lord
our Maker let us fall.
7For he's our God, the people we
of his own pasture are,
And of his hand the sheep; to-day,
if ye his voice will hear,
8Then harden not your hearts, as in
the provocation,
As in the desert, on the day
of the tentation:
9When me your fathers tempt'd and prov'd,
and did my working see;
10Ev'n for the space of forty years
this race hath grieved me.
I said, This people errs in heart,
my ways they do not know:
11To whom I sware in wrath, that to
my rest they should not go.

PSALM 96
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1O sing a new song to the Lord:
sing all the earth to God.
2To God sing, bless his name, shew still
his saving health abroad.
3Among the heathen nations
his glory do declare;
And unto all the people shew
his works that wondrous are.
4For great's the Lord,
and greatly he is to be magnify'd;
Yea, worthy to be fear'd is he
above all gods beside.
5For all the gods are idols dumb,
which blinded nations fear;
But our God is the Lord, by whom
the heav'ns created were.
6Great honour is before his face,
and majesty divine;
Strength is within his holy place,
and there doth beauty shine.
7Do ye ascribe unto the Lord,
of people ev'ry tribe,
Glory do ye unto the Lord,
and mighty pow'r ascribe.
8Give ye the glory to the Lord
that to his name is due;
Come ye into his courts, and bring
an offering with you.
9In beauty of his holiness,
O do the Lord adore;
Likewise let all the earth throughout
tremble his face before.
10Among the heathen say, God reigns;
the world shall stedfastly
Be fix'd from moving; he shall judge
the people righteously.
11Let heav'ns be glad before the Lord,
and let the earth rejoice;
Let seas, and all that is therein,
cry out, and make a noise.
12Let fields rejoice, and ev'ry thing
that springeth of the earth:
Then woods and ev'ry tree shall sing
with gladness and with mirth
13Before the Lord; because he comes,
to judge the earth comes he:
He'll judge the world with righteousness,
the people faithfully.

PSALM 97
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1God reigneth, let the earth be glad,
and isles rejoice each one.
2Dark clouds him compass; and in right
with judgment dwells his throne.
3Fire goes before him,
and his foes it burns up round about:
4His lightnings lighten did the world; earth saw,
and shook throughout.
5Hills at the presence of the Lord,
like wax, did melt away;
Ev'n at the presence of the Lord
of all the earth, I say.
6The heav'ns declare his righteousness,
all men his glory see.
7All who serve graven images,
confounded let them be.
Who do of idols boast themselves,
let shame upon them fall:
Ye that are called gods, see that
ye do him worship all.
8Sion did hear, and joyful was,
glad Judah's daughters were;
They much rejoic'd, O Lord, because
thy judgments did appear.
9For thou, O Lord, art high above
all things on earth that are;
Above all other gods thou art
exalted very far.
10Hate ill, all ye that love the Lord:
his saints' souls keepeth he;
And from the hands of wicked men
he sets them safe and free.
11For all those that be righteous
sown is a joyful light,
And gladness sown is for all those
that are in heart upright.
12Ye righteous, in the Lord rejoice;
express your thankfulness,
When ye into your memory
do call his holiness.

PSALM 98
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1O sing a new song to the Lord,
for wonders he hath done:
His right hand and his holy arm
him victory hath won.
2The Lord God his salvation
hath caused to be known;
His justice in the heathen's sight
he openly hath shown.
3He mindful of his grace and truth
to Isr'el's house hath been;
And the salvation of our God
all ends of th' earth have seen.
4Let all the earth unto the Lord
send forth a joyful noise;
Lift up your voice aloud to him,
sing praises, and rejoice.
5With harp, with harp, and voice of psalms,
unto JEHOVAH sing:
6With trumpets, cornets, gladly sound
before the Lord the King.
7Let seas and all their fulness roar;
the world, and dwellers there;
8Let floods clap hands, and let the hills
together joy declare
9Before the Lord; because he comes,
to judge the earth comes he:
He'll judge the world with righteousness,
his folk with equity.

PSALM 99
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Th' eternal Lord doth reign as king,
let all the people quake;
He sits between the cherubims,
let th' earth be mov'd and shake.
2The Lord in Sion great and high
above all people is;
3Thy great and dreadful name (for it
is holy) let them bless.
4The king's strength also judgment loves;
thou settlest equity:
Just judgment thou dost execute
in Jacob righteously.
5The Lord our God exalt on high,
and rev'rently do ye
Before his footstool worship him:
the Holy One is he.
6Moses and Aaron 'mong his priests,
Samuel, with them that call
Upon his name: these call'd on God,
and he them answer'd all.
7Within the pillar of the cloud
he unto them did speak:
The testimonies he them taught,
and laws, they did not break.
8Thou answer'dst them, O Lord our God;
thou wast a God that gave
Pardon to them, though on their deeds
thou wouldest vengeance have.
9Do ye exalt the Lord our God,
and at his holy hill
Do ye him worship: for the Lord
our God is holy still.

Psalm of praise.
1All people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice.
2Him serve with mirth, his praise forth tell,
Come ye before him and rejoice.
3Know that the Lord is God indeed;
Without our aid he did us make:
We are his flock, he doth us feed,
And for his sheep he doth us take.
4O enter then his gates with praise,
Approach with joy his courts unto:
Praise, laud, and bless his name always,
For it is seemly so to do.
5For why? the Lord our God is good,
His mercy is for ever sure;
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure.

3Know ye the Lord that he is God;

We are his people, and the sheep
within his pasture fed.
4Enter his gates and courts with praise,
to thank him go ye thither:
To him express your thankfulness,
and bless his name together.
5Because the Lord our God is good,
his mercy faileth never;
And to all generations

1I mercy will and judgment sing,
Lord, I will sing to thee.
2With wisdom in a perfect way
shall my behaviour be.
O when, in kindness unto me,
wilt thou be pleas'd to come?
I with a perfect heart will walk
within my house at home.
3I will endure no wicked thing
before mine eyes to be:
I hate their work that turn aside,
it shall not cleave to me.
4A stubborn and a froward heart
depart quite from me shall;
A person giv'n to wickedness
I will not know at all.
5I'll cut him off that slandereth
his neighbour privily:
The haughty heart I will not bear,
nor him that looketh high.
6Upon the faithful of the land
mine eyes shall be, that they
May dwell with me: he shall me serve
that walks in perfect way.
7Who of deceit a worker is
in my house shall not dwell;
And in my presence shall he not
remain that lies doth tell.
8Yea, all the wicked of the land
early destroy will I;
All from God's city to cut off
that work iniquity.

PSALM 102
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the Lord.
1O Lord, unto my pray'r give ear,
my cry let come to thee;
2And in the day of my distress
hide not thy face from me.
Give ear to me; what time I call,
to answer me make haste:
3For, as an hearth, my bones are burnt,
my days, like smoke, do waste.
4My heart within me smitten is,
and it is withered
Like very grass; so that I do
forget to eat my bread.
5By reason of my groaning voice
my bones cleave to my skin.
6Like pelican in wilderness
forsaken I have been:
I like an owl in desert am,
that nightly there doth moan;
7I watch, and like a sparrow am
on the house-top alone.
8My bitter en'mies all the day
reproaches cast on me;
And, being mad at me, with rage
against me sworn they be.
9For why? I ashes eaten have
like bread, in sorrows deep;
My drink I also mingled have
with tears that I did weep.
10Thy wrath and indignation
did cause this grief and pain;
For thou hast lift me up on high,
and cast me down again.
11My days are like unto a shade,
which doth declining pass;
And I am dry'd and withered,
ev'n like unto the grass.
12But thou, Lord, everlasting art,
and thy remembrance shall
Continually endure,
and be to generations all.
13Thou shalt arise, and mercy have
upon thy Sion yet;
The time to favour her is come,
the time that thou hast set.
14For in her rubbish and her stones
thy servants pleasure take;
Yea, they the very dust thereof
do favour for her sake.
15So shall the heathen people fear
the Lord's most holy name;
And all the kings on earth shall dread
thy glory and thy fame.
16When Sion by the mighty Lord
built up again shall be,
In glory then and majesty
to men appear shall he.
17The prayer of the destitute
he surely will regard;
Their prayer will he not despise,
by him it shall be heard.
18For generations yet to come
this shall be on record:
So shall the people that shall be
created praise the Lord.
19He from his sanctuary's height
hath downward cast his eye;
And from his glorious throne in heav'n
the Lord the earth did spy;
20That of the mournful prisoner
the groanings he might hear,
To set them free that unto death
by men appointed are:
21That they in Sion may declare
the Lord's most holy name,
And publish in Jerusalem
the praises of the same;
22When as the people gather shall
in troops with one accord,
When kingdoms shall assembled be
to serve the highest Lord.
23My wonted strength and force he hath
abated in the way,
And he my days hath shortened:
24Thus therefore did I say,
My God, in mid-time of my days
take thou me not away:
From age to age eternally
thy years endure and stay.
25The firm foundation of the earth
of old time thou hast laid;
The heavens also are the work
which thine own hands have made.
26Thou shalt for evermore endure,
but they shall perish all;
Yea, ev'ry one of them wax old,
like to a garment, shall:
Thou, as a vesture, shalt them change,
and they shall changed be:
27But thou the same art,
and thy years are to eternity.
28The children of thy servants shall
continually endure;
And in thy sight, O Lord, their seed
shall be establish'd sure.

PSALM 102b
Second Version
Meter: 8,8,8,8
1Lord, hear my pray'r, and let my cry
Have speedy access unto thee;
2In day of my calamity
O hide not thou thy face from me.
Hear when I call to thee; that day
An answer speedily return:
3My days, like smoke, consume away,
And, as an hearth, my bones do burn.
4My heart is wounded very sore,
And withered, like grass doth fade:
I am forgetful grown therefore
To take and eat my daily bread.
5By reason of my smart within,
And voice of my most grievous groans,
My flesh consumed is, my skin,
All parch'd, doth cleave unto my bones.
6The pelican of wilderness,
The owl in desert, I do match;
7And, sparrow-like, companionless,
Upon the house's top, I watch.
8I all day long am made a scorn,
Reproach'd by my malicious foes:
The madmen are against me sworn,
The men against me that arose.
9For I have ashes eaten up,
To me as if they had been bread;
And with my drink I in my cup
Of bitter tears a mixture made.
10Because thy wrath was not appeas'd,
And dreadful indignation:
Therefore it was that thou me rais'd,
And thou again didst cast me down.
11My days are like a shade alway,
Which doth declining swiftly pass;
And I am withered away,
Much like unto the fading grass.
12But thou, O Lord, shalt still endure,
From change and all mutation free,
And to all generations sure
Shall thy remembrance ever be.
13Thou shalt arise, and mercy yet
Thou to mount Sion shalt extend:
Her time for favour which was set,
Behold, is now come to an end.
14Thy saints take pleasure in her stones,
Her very dust to them is dear.
15All heathen lands and kingly thrones
On earth thy glorious name shall fear.
16God in his glory shall appear,
When Sion he builds and repairs.
17He shall regard and lend his ear
Unto the needy's humble pray'rs:
Th' afflicted's pray'r he will not scorn.
18All times this shall be on record:
And generations yet unborn
Shall praise and magnify the Lord.
19He from his holy place look'd down,
The earth he view'd from heav'n on high;
20To hear the pris'ner's mourning groan,
And free them that are doom'd to die;
21That Sion, and Jerus'lem too,
His name and praise may well record,
22When people and the kingdoms do
Assemble all to praise the Lord.
23My strength he weaken'd in the way,
My days of life he shortened
24My God, O take me not away
In mid-time of my days, I said:
Thy years throughout all ages last
25Of old thou hast established
The earth's foundation firm and fast:
Thy mighty hands the heav'ns have made.
26They perish shall, as garments do,
But thou shalt evermore endure;
As vestures, thou shalt change them so;
And they shall all be changed sure:
27But from all changes thou art free;
Thy endless years do last for aye
28Thy servants, and their seed who be,
Establish'd shall before thee stay.

PSALM 103
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
A Psalm of David.
1O thou my soul, bless God the Lord;
and all that in me is
Be stirred up his holy name
to magnify and bless.
2Bless, O my soul, the Lord thy God,
and not forgetful be
Of all his gracious benefits
he hath bestow'd on thee.
3All thine iniquities who doth
most graciously forgive:
Who thy diseases all and pains doth heal,
and thee relieve.
4Who doth redeem thy life, that thou
to death may'st not go down;
Who thee with loving-kindness doth
and tender mercies crown:
5Who with abundance of good things
doth satisfy thy mouth;
So that, ev'n as the eagle's age,
renewed is thy youth.
6God righteous judgment executes
for all oppressed ones.
7His ways to Moses, he his acts
made known to Isr'el's sons.
8The Lord our God is merciful,
and he is gracious,
Long-suffering, and slow to wrath,
in mercy plenteous.
9He will not chide continually,
nor keep his anger still.
10With us he dealt not as we sinn'd,
nor did requite our ill.
11For as the heaven in its height
the earth surmounteth far;
So great to those that do him fear
his tender mercies are:
12As far as east is distant from
the west, so far hath he
From us removed, in his love,
all our iniquity.
13Such pity as a father hath
unto his children dear;
Like pity shews the Lord to such
as worship him in fear.
14For he remembers we are dust,
and he our frame well knows.
15Frail man, his days are like the grass,
as flow'r in field he grows:
16For over it the wind doth pass,
and it away is gone;
And of the place where once it was
it shall no more be known.
17But unto them that do him fear
God's mercy never ends;
And to their children's children still
his righteousness extends:
18To such as keep his covenant,
and mindful are alway
Of his most just commandements,
that they may them obey.
19The Lord prepared hath his throne
in heavens firm to stand;
And ev'ry thing that being hath
his kingdom doth command.
20O ye his angels, that excel
in strength, bless ye the Lord;
Ye who obey what he commands,
and hearken to his word.
21O bless and magnify the Lord,
ye glorious hosts of his;
Ye ministers, that do fulfil
whate'er his pleasure is.
22O bless the Lord, all ye his works,
wherewith the world is stor'd
In his dominions ev'ry where.
My soul, bless thou the Lord.

PSALM 104
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Bless God, my soul. O Lord my God,
thou art exceeding great;
With honour and with majesty
thou clothed art in state.
2With light, as with a robe, thyself
thou coverest about;
And, like unto a curtain, thou
the heavens stretchest out.
3Who of his chambers doth the beams
within the waters lay;
Who doth the clouds his chariot make,
on wings of wind make way.
4Who flaming fire his ministers,
his angels sp'rits, doth make:
5Who earth's foundations did lay,
that it should never shake.
6Thou didst it cover with the deep,
as with a garment spread:
The waters stood above the hills,
when thou the word but said.
7But at the voice of thy rebuke
they fled, and would not stay;
They at thy thunder's dreadful voice
did haste them fast away.
8They by the mountains do ascend,
and by the valley-ground
Descend, unto that very place
which thou for them didst found.
9Thou hast a bound unto them set,
that they may not pass over,
That they do not return again
the face of earth to cover.
10He to the valleys sends the springs,
which run among the hills:
11They to all beasts of field give drink,
wild asses drink their fills.
12By them the fowls of heav'n shall have
their habitation,
Which do among the branches sing
with delectation.
13He from his chambers watereth
the hills, when they are dry'd:
With fruit and increase of thy works
the earth is satisfy'd.
14For cattle he makes grass to grow,
he makes the herb to spring
For th' use of man, that food to him
he from the earth may bring;
15And wine, that to the heart of man
doth cheerfulness impart,
Oil that his face makes shine,
and bread that strengtheneth his heart.
16The trees of God are full of sap;
the cedars that do stand
In Lebanon, which planted were
by his almighty hand.
17Birds of the air upon their boughs
do chuse their nests to make;
As for the stork, the fir-tree she
doth for her dwelling take.
18The lofty mountains for wild goats
a place of refuge be;
The conies also to the rocks
do for their safety flee.
19He sets the moon in heav'n, thereby
the seasons to discern:
From him the sun his certain time
of going down doth learn.
20Thou darkness mak'st, 'tis night, then beasts
of forests creep abroad.
21The lions young roar for their prey,
and seek their meat from God.
22The sun doth rise, and home they flock,
down in their dens they lie.
23Man goes to work, his labour he
doth to the ev'ning ply.
24How manifold, Lord, are thy works!
in wisdom wonderful
Thou ev'ry one of them hast made;
earth's of thy riches full:
25So is this great and spacious sea,
wherein things creeping are,
Which number'd cannot be; and beasts
both great and small are there.
26There ships go; there thou mak'st to play
that leviathan great.
27These all wait on thee, that thou may'st
in due time give them meat.
28That which thou givest unto them
they gather for their food;
Thine hand thou open'st lib'rally,
they filled are with good.
29Thou hid'st thy face; they troubled are,
their breath thou tak'st away;
Then do they die, and to their dust
return again do they.
30Thy quick'ning spirit thou send'st forth,
then they created be;
And then the earth's decayed face
renewed is by thee.
31The glory of the mighty Lord
continue shall for ever:
The Lord JEHOVAH shall rejoice
in all his works together.
32Earth, as affrighted, trembleth all,
if he on it but look;
And if the mountains he but touch,
they presently do smoke.
33I will sing to the Lord most high,
so long as I shall live;
And while I being have I shall
to my God praises give.
34Of him my meditation shall
sweet thoughts to me afford;
And as for me, I will rejoice
in God, my only Lord.
35From earth let sinners be consum'd,
let ill men no more be.
O thou my soul, bless thou the Lord.
Praise to the Lord give ye.

PSALM 105
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Give thanks to God, call on his name;
to men his deeds make known.
2Sing ye to him, sing psalms; proclaim
his wondrous works each one.
3See that ye in his holy name
to glory do accord;
And let the heart of ev'ry one
rejoice that seeks the Lord.
4The Lord Almighty, and his strength,
with stedfast hearts seek ye:
His blessed and his gracious face
seek ye continually.
5Think on the works that he hath done,
which admiration breed;
His wonders, and the judgments all
which from his mouth proceed;
6O ye that are of Abr'ham's race,
his servant well approv'n;
And ye that Jacob's children are,
whom he chose for his own.
7Because he, and he only, is
the mighty Lord our God;
And his most righteous judgments are
in all the earth abroad.
8His cov'nant he remember'd hath,
that it may ever stand:
To thousand generations
the word he did command.
9Which covenant he firmly made
with faithful Abraham,
And unto Isaac, by his oath,
he did renew the same:
10And unto Jacob, for a law,
he made it firm and sure,
A covenant to Israel,
which ever should endure.
11He said, I'll give Canaan's land
for heritage to you;
12While they were strangers there,
and few, in number very few:
13While yet they went from land to land
without a sure abode;
And while through sundry kingdoms they
did wander far abroad;
14Yet, notwithstanding suffer'd he
no man to do them wrong:
Yea, for their sakes, he did reprove
kings, who were great and strong.
15Thus did he say, Touch ye not those
that mine anointed be,
Nor do the prophets any harm
that do pertain to me.
16He call'd for famine on the land,
he brake the staff of bread:
17But yet he sent a man before,
by whom they should be fed;
Ev'n Joseph, whom unnat'rally
sell for a slave did they;
18Whose feet with fetters they did hurt,
and he in irons lay;
19Until the time that his word came
to give him liberty;
The word and purpose of the Lord
did him in prison try.
20Then sent the king, and did command
that he enlarg'd should be:
He that the people's ruler was
did send to set him free.
21A lord to rule his family
he rais'd him, as most fit;
To him of all that he possess'd
he did the charge commit:
22That he might at his pleasure bind
the princes of the land;
And he might teach his senators
wisdom to understand.
23The people then of Israel
down into Egypt came;
And Jacob also sojourned
within the land of Ham.
24And he did greatly by his pow'r
increase his people there;
And stronger than their enemies
they by his blessing were.
25Their heart he turned to envy
his folk maliciously,
With those that his own servants were
to deal in subtilty.
26His servant Moses he did send,
Aaron his chosen one.
27By these his signs and wonders great
in Ham's land were made known.
28Darkness he sent, and made it dark;
his word they did obey.
29He turn'd their waters into blood,
and he their fish did slay.
30The land in plenty brought forth frogs
in chambers of their kings.
31His word all sorts of flies and lice
in all their borders brings.
32He hail for rain, and flaming fire
into their land he sent:
33And he their vines and fig-trees smote:
trees of their coasts he rent.
34He spake, and caterpillars came,
locusts did much abound;
35Which in their land all herbs consum'd,
and all fruits of their ground.
36He smote all first-born in their land,
chief of their strength each one.
37With gold and silver brought them forth,
weak in their tribes were none.
38Egypt was glad when forth they went,
their fear on them did light.
39He spread a cloud for covering,
and fire to shine by night.
40They ask'd, and he brought quails:
with bread of heav'n he filled them.
41He open'd rocks, floods gush'd,
and ran in deserts like a stream.
42For on his holy promise he,
and servant Abr'ham, thought.
43With joy his people, his elect
with gladness, forth he brought.
44And unto them the pleasant lands
he of the heathen gave;
That of the people's labour they
inheritance might have.
45That they his statutes might observe
according to his word;
And that they might his laws obey.
Give praise unto the Lord.

PSALM 106
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Give praise and thanks unto the Lord,
for bountiful is he;
His tender mercy doth endure
unto eternity.
2God's mighty works who can express?
or shew forth all his praise?
3Blessed are they that judgment keep,
and justly do always.
4Remember me, Lord, with that love
which thou to thine dost bear;
With thy salvation, O my God,
to visit me draw near:
5That I thy chosen's good may see,
and in their joy rejoice;
And may with thine inheritance
triumph with cheerful voice.
6We with our fathers sinned have,
and of iniquity
Too long we have the workers been;
we have done wickedly.
7The wonders great, which thou, O Lord,
didst work in Egypt land,
Our fathers, though they saw, yet them
they did not understand:
And they thy mercies' multitude
kept not in memory;
But at the sea, ev'n the Red sea,
provok'd him grievously.
8Nevertheless he saved them,
ev'n for his own name's sake;
That so he might to be well known
his mighty power make.
9When he the Red sea did rebuke,
then dried up it was:
Through depths, as through the wilderness,
he safely made them pass.
10From hands of those that hated them
he did his people save;
And from the en'my's cruel hand
to them redemption gave.
11The waters overwhelm'd their foes;
not one was left alive.
12Then they believ'd his word,
and praise to him in songs did give.
13But soon did they his mighty works
forget unthankfully,
And on his counsel and his will
did not wait patiently;
14But much did lust in wilderness,
and God in desert tempt.
15He gave them what they sought, but to
their soul he leanness sent.
16And against Moses in the camp
their envy did appear;
At Aaron they, the saint of God,
envious also were.
17Therefore the earth did open wide,
and Dathan did devour,
And all Abiram's company
did cover in that hour.
18Likewise among their company
a fire was kindled then;
And so the hot consuming flame
burnt up these wicked men.
19Upon the hill of Horeb they
an idol-calf did frame,
A molten image they did make,
and worshipped the same.
20And thus their glory, and their God,
most vainly changed they
Into the likeness of an ox
that eateth grass or hay.
21They did forget the mighty God,
that had their saviour been,
By whom such great things brought to pass
they had in Egypt seen.
22In Ham's land he did wondrous works,
things terrible did he,
When he his mighty hand and arm
stretch'd out at the Red sea.
23Then said he, He would them destroy,
had not, his wrath to stay,
His chosen Moses stood in breach,
that them he should not slay.
24Yea, they despis'd the pleasant land,
believed not his word:
25But in their tents they murmured,
not heark'ning to the Lord.
26Therefore in desert them to slay
he lifted up his hand:
27'Mong nations to o'erthrow their seed,
and scatter in each land.
28They unto Baal-peor did
themselves associate;
The sacrifices of the dead
they did profanely eat.
29Thus, by their lewd inventions,
they did provoke his ire;
And then upon them suddenly
the plague brake in as fire.
30Then Phin'has rose, and justice did,
and so the plague did cease;
31That to all ages counted was
to him for righteousness.
32And at the waters, where they strove,
they did him angry make,
In such sort, that it fared ill
with Moses for their sake:
33Because they there his spirit meek
provoked bitterly,
So that he utter'd with his lips
words unadvisedly.
34Nor, as the Lord commanded them,
did they the nations slay:
35But with the heathen mingled were,
and learn'd of them their way.
36And they their idols serv'd, which did
a snare unto them turn.
37Their sons and daughters they to dev'ls
in sacrifice did burn.
38In their own children's guiltless blood
their hands they did imbrue,
Whom to Canaan's idols they
for sacrifices slew:
So was the land defil'd with blood.
39They stain'd with their own way,
And with their own inventions
a whoring they did stray.
40Against his people kindled was
the wrath of God therefore,
Insomuch that he did his own
inheritance abhor.
41He gave them to the heathen's hand;
their foes did them command.
42Their en'mies them oppress'd, they were
made subject to their hand.
43He many times deliver'd them;
but with their counsel so
They him provok'd, that for their sin
they were brought very low.
44Yet their affliction he beheld,
when he did hear their cry:
45And he for them his covenant
did call to memory;
After his mercies' multitude
46he did repent: And made
Them to be pity'd of all those
who did them captive lead.
47O Lord our God, us save,
and gather the heathen from among,
That we thy holy name may praise
in a triumphant song.
48Bless'd be JEHOVAH, Isr'el's God,
to all eternity:
Let all the people say, Amen.
Praise to the Lord give ye.

PSALM 107
Book 5
Psalms 107â€”150
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Praise God, for he is good: for still
his mercies lasting be.
2Let God's redeem'd say so, whom he
from th' en'my's hand did free;
3And gather'd them out of the lands,
from north, south, east, nd west.
4They stray'd in desert's pathless way,
no city found to rest.
5For thirst and hunger in them faints
6their soul. When straits them press,
They cry unto the Lord,
and he them frees from their distress.
7Them also in a way to walk
that right is he did guide,
That they might to a city go,
wherein they might abide.
8O that men to the Lord would give
praise for his goodness then,
And for his works of wonder done
unto the sons of men!
9For he the soul that longing is
doth fully satisfy;
With goodness he the hungry soul
doth fill abundantly.
10Such as shut up in darkness deep,
and in death's shade abide,
Whom strongly hath affliction bound,
and irons fast have ty'd:
11Because against the words of God
they wrought rebelliously,
And they the counsel did contemn
of him that is most High:
12Their heart he did bring down with grief,
they fell, no help could have.
13In trouble then they cry'd to God,
he them from straits did save.
14He out of darkness did them bring,
and from death's shade them take;
These bands, wherewith they had been bound,
asunder quite he brake.
15O that men to the Lord would give
praise for his goodness then,
And for his works of wonder done
unto the sons of men!
16Because the mighty gates of brass
in pieces he did tear,
By him in sunder also cut
the bars of iron were.
17Fools, for their sin, and their offence,
do sore affliction bear;
18All kind of meat their soul abhors;
they to death's gates draw near.
19In grief they cry to God; he saves
them from their miseries.
20He sends his word, them heals,
and them from their destructions frees.
21O that men to the Lord would give
praise for his goodness then,
And for his works of wonder done
unto the sons of men!
22And let them sacrifice to him
off 'rings of thankfulness;
And let them shew abroad his works
in songs of joyfulness.
23Who go to sea in ships,
and in great waters trading be,
24Within the deep these men God's works
and his great wonders see.
25For he commands,
and forth in haste the stormy tempest flies,
Which makes the sea with rolling waves
aloft to swell and rise.
26They mount to heav'n, then to the depths
they do go down again;
Their soul doth faint and melt away
with trouble and with pain.
27They reel and stagger like one drunk,
at their wit's end they be:
28Then they to God in trouble cry,
who them from straits doth free.
29The storm is chang'd into a calm
at his command and will;
So that the waves, which rag'd before,
now quiet are and still.
30Then are they glad, because at rest
and quiet now they be:
So to the haven he them brings,
which they desir'd to see.
31O that men to the Lord would give
praise for his goodness then,
And for his works of wonder done
unto the sons of men!
32Among the people gathered
let them exalt his name;
Among assembled elders spread
his most renowned fame.
33He to dry land turns water-springs,
and floods to wilderness;
34For sins of those that dwell therein,
fat land to barrenness.
35The burnt and parched wilderness
to water-pools he brings;
The ground that was dry'd up before
he turns to water-springs:
36And there, for dwelling, he a place
doth to the hungry give,
That they a city may prepare
commodiously to live.
37There sow they fields, and vineyards plant,
to yield fruits of increase.
38His blessing makes them multiply,
lets not their beasts decrease.
39Again they are diminished,
and very low brought down,
Through sorrow and affliction,
and great oppression.
40He upon princes pours contempt,
and causeth them to stray,
And wander in a wilderness,
wherein there is no way.
41Yet setteth he the poor on high
from all his miseries,
And he, much like unto a flock,
doth make him families.
42They that are righteous shall rejoice,
when they the same shall see;
And, as ashamed, stop her mouth
shall all iniquity.
43Whoso is wise, and will these things
observe, and them record,
Ev'n they shall understand the love
and kindness of the Lord.

PSALM 108

A Song or Psalm of David.
1My heart is fix'd, Lord; I will sing,
and with my glory praise.
2Awake up psaltery and harp;
myself I'll early raise.
3I'll praise thee 'mong the people, Lord;
'mong nations sing will I:
4For above heav'n thy mercy's great,
thy truth doth reach the sky.
5Be thou above the heavens, Lord,
exalted gloriously;
Thy glory all the earth above
be lifted up on high.
6That those who thy beloved are
delivered may be,
O do thou save with thy right hand,
and answer give to me.
7God in his holiness hath said,
Herein I will take pleasure;
Shechem I will divide, and forth
will Succoth's valley measure.
8Gilead I claim as mine by right;
Manasseh mine shall be;
Ephraim is of my head the strength;
Judah gives laws for me;
9Moab's my washing-pot; my shoe
I'll over Edom throw;
Over the land of Palestine
I will in triumph go.
10O who is he will bring me to
the city fortify'd?
O who is he that to the land
of Edom will me guide?
11O God, thou who hadst cast us off,
this thing wilt thou not do?
And wilt not thou, ev'n thou, O God,
forth with our armies go?
12Do thou from trouble give us help,
for helpless is man's aid.
13Through God we shall do valiantly;
our foes he shall down tread.

PSALM 109
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician,
A Psalm of David.
1O thou the God of all my praise,
do thou not hold thy peace;
2For mouths of wicked men to speak
against me do not cease:
The mouths of vile deceitful men
against me open'd be;
And with a false and lying tongue
they have accused me.
3They did beset me round about
with words of hateful spight:
And though to them no cause I gave,
against me they did fight.
4They for my love became my foes,
but I me set to pray.
5Evil for good, hatred for love,
to me they did repay.
6Set thou the wicked over him;
and upon his right hand
Give thou his greatest enemy,
ev'n Satan, leave to stand.
7And when by thee he shall be judg'd,
let him condemned be;
And let his pray'r be turn'd to sin,
when he shall call on thee.
8Few be his days, and in his room
his charge another take.
9His children let be fatherless,
his wife a widow make.
10His children let be vagabonds,
and beg continually;
And from their places desolate
seek bread for their supply.
11Let covetous extortioners
catch all he hath away:
Of all for which he labour'd hath
let strangers make a prey.
12Let there be none to pity him,
let there be none at all
That on his children fatherless
will let his mercy fall.
13Let his posterity from earth
cut off for ever be,
And in the foll'wing age their name
be blotted out by thee.
14Let God his father's wickedness
still to remembrance call;
And never let his mother's sin
be blotted out at all.
15But let them all before the Lord
appear continually,
That he may wholly from the earth
cut off their memory.
16Because he mercy minded not,
but persecuted still
The poor and needy, that he might
the broken-hearted kill.
17As he in cursing pleasure took,
so let it to him fall;
As he delighted not to bless,
so bless him not at all.
18As cursing he like clothes put on,
into his bowels so,
Like water, and into his bones,
like oil, down let it go.
19Like to the garment let it be
which doth himself array,
And for a girdle, wherewith he
is girt about alway.
20From God let this be their reward
that en'mies are to me,
And their reward that speak against
my soul maliciously.
21But do thou, for thine own name's sake,
O God the Lord, for me:
Sith good and sweet thy mercy is,
from trouble set me free.
22For I am poor and indigent,
afflicted sore am I,
My heart within me also is
wounded exceedingly.
23I pass like a declining shade,
am like the locust tost:
24My knees through fasting weaken'd are,
my flesh hath fatness lost.
25I also am a vile reproach
unto them made to be;
And they that did upon me look
did shake their heads at me.
26O do thou help and succour me,
who art my God and Lord:
And, for thy tender mercy's sake,
safety to me afford:
27That thereby they may know that this
is thy almighty hand;
And that thou, Lord, hast done the same,
they may well understand.
28Although they curse with spite, yet, Lord,
bless thou with loving voice:
Let them asham'd be when they rise;
thy servant let rejoice.
29Let thou mine adversaries all
with shame be clothed over;
And let their own confusion
them, as a mantle, cover.
30But as for me, I with my mouth
will greatly praise the Lord;
And I among the multitude
his praises will record.
31For he shall stand at his right hand
who is in poverty,
To save him from all those that would
condemn his soul to die.

PSALM 110

Sit thou at my right hand,
Until I make thy foes a stool,

2The Lord shall out of Sion send
the rod of thy great pow'r:
In midst of all thine enemies
be thou the governor.
3A willing people in thy day
of pow'r shall come to thee,
In holy beauties from morn's womb;
thy youth like dew shall be.
4The Lord himself hath made an oath,
and will repent him never,
Of th' order of Melchisedec
thou art a priest for ever.
5The glorious and mighty Lord,
that sits at thy right hand,
Shall, in his day of wrath, strike through
kings that do him withstand.
6He shall among the heathen judge,
he shall with bodies dead
The places fill: o'er many lands
he wound shall ev'ry head.
7The brook that runneth in the way
with drink shall him supply;
And, for this cause, in triumph he
shall lift his head on high.

3His work most honourable is,
most glorious and pure,
And his untainted righteousness

4His works most wonderful he hath
made to be thought upon:
The Lord is gracious,
and he is full of compassion.
5He giveth meat unto all those
that truly do him fear;
And evermore his covenant
he in his mind will bear.
6He did the power of his works
unto his people show,
When he the heathen's heritage
upon them did bestow.
7His handy-works are truth and right;
all his commands are sure:
8And, done in truth and uprightness,
they evermore endure.
9He sent redemption to his folk;
his covenant for aye
He did command: holy his name
and rev'rend is alway.

good understanding they
Have all that his commands fulfill:
his praise endures for aye.

Of upright men blessed shall be

3Riches and wealth shall ever be

And his unspotted righteousness

4Unto the upright light doth rise,
though he in darkness be:
Compassionate, and merciful,

5A good man doth his favour shew,
and doth to others lend:
He with discretion his affairs
will guide unto the end.
6Surely there is not any thing
that ever shall him move:
The righteous man's memorial
shall everlasting prove.
7When he shall evil tidings hear,
he shall not be afraid:
His heart is fix'd, his confidence
upon the Lord is stay'd.
8His heart is firmly stablished,
afraid he shall not be,
Until upon his enemies

9He hath dispers'd, giv'n to the poor;

To ages all; with honour shall

his teeth gnash, melt away:
What wicked men do most desire
shall utterly decay.

Of sons a mother full of joy.

Jordan was driven back.
4Like rams the mountains, and like lambs

5O sea, why fledd'st thou? Jordan, back
why wast thou driven so?
6Ye mountains great, wherefore was it

And wherefore was it, little hills,

Unto thy name, ev'n for thy truth,

2O wherefore should the heathen say,
Where is their God now gone?
3But our God in the heavens is,
what pleas'd him he hath done.
4Their idols silver are and gold,
work of men's hands they be.
5Mouths have they, but they do not speak;
and eyes, but do not see;
6Ears have they, but they do not hear;
noses, but savour not;
7Hands, feet, but handle not, nor walk;
nor speak they through their throat.
8Like them their makers are, and all
on them their trust that build.
9O Isr'el, trust thou in the Lord,
he is their help and shield.
10O Aaron's house, trust in the Lord,
their help and shield is he.
11Ye that fear God, trust in the Lord,
their help and shield he'll be.
12The Lord of us hath mindful been,
and he will bless us still:
He will the house of Isr'el bless,
bless Aaron's house he will.
13Both small and great, that fear the Lord,
he will them surely bless.
14The Lord will you, you and your seed,
aye more and more increase.
15O blessed are ye of the Lord,
who made the earth and heav'n.
16The heav'n, ev'n heav'ns, are God's, but he
earth to men's sons hath giv'n.

God's praise do not record.

3Of death the cords and sorrows did
about me compass round;
The pains of hell took hold on me,
I grief and trouble found.
4Upon the name of God the Lord
then did I call, and say,
Deliver thou my soul, O Lord,
I do thee humbly pray.

7O thou my soul, do thou return
unto thy quiet rest;
For largely, lo, the Lord to thee
his bounty hath exprest.
8For my distressed soul from death
deliver'd was by thee:
Thou didst my mourning eyes from tears,
my feet from falling, free.
9I in the land of those that live
will walk the Lord before.
10I did believe, therefore I spake:
I was afflicted sore.
11I said, when I was in my haste,
that all men liars be.
12What shall I render to the Lord
for all his gifts to me?
13I'll of salvation take the cup,
on God's name will I call:
14I'll pay my vows now to the Lord
before his people all.
15Dear in God's sight is his saints' death.
16Thy servant, Lord, am I;
Thy servant sure, thine handmaid's son:
my bands thou didst untie.
17Thank-off 'rings I to thee will give,
and on God's name will call.
18I'll pay my vows now to the Lord
before his people all;
19Within the courts of God's own house,
within the midst of thee,
O city of Jerusalem.
Praise to the Lord give ye.

PSALM 117
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1O give ye praise unto the Lord,
all nations that be;
Likewise, ye people all, accord
his name to magnify.
2For great to us-ward ever are
his loving-kindnesses:
His truth endures for evermore.
The Lord O do ye bless.

PSALM 118
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1O praise the Lord, for he is good;
his mercy lasteth ever.
2Let those of Israel now say,
His mercy faileth never.
3Now let the house of Aaron say,
His mercy lasteth ever.
4Let those that fear the Lord now say,
His mercy faileth never.
5I in distress call'd on the Lord;
the Lord did answer me:
He in a large place did me set,
from trouble made me free.
6The mighty Lord is on my side,
I will not be afraid;
For any thing that man can do
I shall not be dismay'd.
7The Lord doth take my part with them
that help to succour me:
Therefore on those that do me hate
I my desire shall see.
8Better it is to trust in God
than trust in man's defence;
9Better to trust in God than make
princes our confidence.
10The nations, joining all in one,
did compass me about:
But in the Lord's most holy name
I shall them all root out.
11They compass'd me about; I say,
they compass'd me about:
But in the Lord's most holy name
I shall them all root out.
12Like bees they compass'd me about;
like unto thorns that flame
They quenched are: for them shall I
destroy in God's own name.
13Thou sore hast thrust, that I might fall,
but my Lord helped me.
14God my salvation is become,
my strength and song is he.
15In dwellings of the righteous
is heard the melody
Of joy and health: the Lord's right hand
doth ever valiantly.
16The right hand of the mighty Lord
exalted is on high;
The right hand of the mighty Lord
doth ever valiantly.
17I shall not die, but live,
and shall the works of God discover.
18The Lord hath me chastised sore,
but not to death giv'n over.
19O set ye open unto me
the gates of righteousness;
Then will I enter into them,
and I the Lord will bless.
20This is the gate of God, by it
the just shall enter in.
21Thee will I praise, for thou me heard'st
and hast my safety been.
22That stone is made head corner-stone,
which builders did despise:
23This is the doing of the Lord,
and wondrous in our eyes.
24This is the day God made, in it
we'll joy triumphantly.
25Save now, I pray thee, Lord; I pray,
send now prosperity.
26Blessed is he in God's great name
that cometh us to save:
We, from the house which to the Lord
pertains, you blessed have.
27God is the Lord, who unto us
hath made light to arise:
Bind ye unto the altar's horns
with cords the sacrifice.
28Thou art my God, I'll thee exalt;
my God, I will thee praise.
29Give thanks to God, for he is good:
his mercy lasts always.

PSALM 119
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
Aleph: The 1st Part.
1Blessed are they that undefil'd,
and straight are in the way;
Who in the Lord's most holy law do walk,
and do not stray.
2Blessed are they who to observe
his statutes are inclin'd;
And who do seek the living God
with their whole heart and mind.
3Such in his ways do walk,
and they do no iniquity.
4Thou hast commanded us to keep
thy precepts carefully.
5O that thy statutes to observe
thou would'st my ways direct!
6Then shall I not be sham'd, when I
thy precepts all respect.
7Then with integrity of heart
thee will I praise and bless,
When I the judgments all have learn'd
of thy pure righteousness.
8That I will keep thy statutes all
firmly resolv'd have I:
O do not then, most gracious God,
forsake me utterly.
#Beth: The 2nd Part.
9By what means shall a young man learn
his way to purify?
If he according to thy word
thereto attentive be.
10Unfeignedly thee have I sought
with all my soul and heart:
O let me not from the right path
of thy commands depart.
11Thy word I in my heart have hid,
that I offend not thee.
12O Lord, thou ever blessed art,
thy statutes teach thou me.
13The judgments of thy mouth each one
my lips declared have:
14More joy thy testimonies' way
than riches all me gave.
15I will thy holy precepts make
my meditation;
And carefully I'll have respect
unto thy ways each one.
16Upon thy statutes my delight
shall constantly be set:
And, by thy grace, I never will
thy holy word forget.
#Gimel: The 3rd Part.
17With me thy servant, in thy grace,
deal bountifully, Lord:
That by thy favor I may live,
and duly keep thy word.
18Open mine eyes, that of thy law
the wonders I may see.
19I am a stranger on this earth,
hide not thy laws from me.
20My soul within me breaks,
and doth much fainting still endure,
Through longing that it hath all times
unto thy judgments pure.
21Thou hast rebuk'd the cursed proud,
who from thy precepts swerve.
22Reproach and shame remove from me,
for I thy laws observe.
23Against me princes spake with spite,
while they in council sat:
But I thy servant did upon
thy statutes meditate.
24My comfort, and my heart's delight,
thy testimonies be;
And they, in all my doubts and fears,
are counsellors to me.
#Daleth: The 4th Part.
25My soul to dust cleaves: quicken me,
according to thy word.
26My ways I shew'd, and me thou heard'st:
teach me thy statutes, Lord.
27The way of thy commandements
make me aright to know;
So all thy works that wondrous are
I shall to others show.
28My soul doth melt, and drop away,
for heaviness and grief:
To me, according to thy word,
give strength, and send relief.
29From me the wicked way of lies
let far removed be;
And graciously thy holy law
do thou grant unto me.
30I chosen have the perfect way
of truth and verity:
Thy judgments that most righteous are
before me laid have I.
31I to thy testimonies cleave;
shame do not on me cast.
32I'll run thy precepts' way, when thou
my heart enlarged hast.
#: The th Part.
33Teach me, O Lord, the perfect way
of thy precepts divine,
And to observe it to the end
I shall my heart incline.
34Give understanding unto me,
so keep thy law shall I;
Yea, ev'n with my whole heart I shall
observe it carefully.
35In thy law's path make me to go;
for I delight therein.
36My heart unto thy testimonies,
and not to greed, incline.
37Turn thou away my sight and eyes
from viewing vanity;
And in thy good and holy way
be pleas'd to quicken me.
38Confirm to me thy gracious word,
which I did gladly hear,
Ev'n to thy servant, Lord, who is
devoted to thy fear.
39Turn thou away my fear'd reproach;
for good thy judgments be.
40Lo, for thy precepts I have long'd;
in thy truth quicken me.
#: The th Part.
41Let thy sweet mercies also come
and visit me, O Lord;
Ev'n thy benign salvation,
according to thy word.
42So shall I have wherewith I may
give him an answer just,
Who spitefully reproacheth me;
for in thy word I trust.
43The word of truth out of my mouth
take thou not utterly;
For on thy judgments righteous
my hope doth still rely.
44So shall I keep for evermore
thy law continually.
45And, sith that I thy precepts seek,
I'll walk at liberty.
46I'll speak thy word to kings,
and I with shame shall not be mov'd;
47And will delight myself always
in thy laws, which I lov'd.
48To thy commandments, which I lov'd,
my hands lift up I will;
And I will also meditate
upon thy statutes still.
#: The th Part.
49Remember, Lord, thy gracious word
thou to thy servant spake,
Which, for a ground of my sure hope,
thou causedst me to take.
50This word of thine my comfort is
in mine affliction:
For in my straits I am reviv'd
by this thy word alone.
51The men whose hearts with pride are stuff'd
did greatly me deride;
Yet from thy straight commandements
I have not turn'd aside.
52Thy judgments righteous, O Lord,
which thou of old forth gave,
I did remember, and myself
by them comforted have.
53Horror took hold on me, because
ill men thy law forsake.
54I in my house of pilgrimage
thy laws my songs do make.
55Thy name by night, Lord, I did mind,
and I have kept thy law.
56And this I had, because thy word
I kept, and stood in awe.
#: The th Part.
57Thou my sure portion art alone,
which I did chuse, O Lord:
I have resolv'd, and said, that I
would keep thy holy word.
58With my whole heart I did entreat
thy face and favour free:
According to thy gracious word
be merciful to me.
59I thought upon my former ways,
and did my life well try;
And to thy testimonies pure
my feet then turned I.
60I did not stay, nor linger long,
as those that slothful are;
But hastily thy laws to keep
myself I did prepare.
61Bands of ill men me robb'd; yet I
thy precepts did not slight.
62I'll rise at midnight thee to praise,
ev'n for thy judgments right.
63I am companion to all those
who fear, and thee obey.
64O Lord, thy mercy fills the earth:
teach me thy laws, I pray.
#: The th Part.
65Well hast thou with thy servant dealt,
as thou didst promise give.
66Good judgment me, and knowledge teach,
for I thy word believe.
67Ere I afflicted was I stray'd;
but now I keep thy word.
68Both good thou art, and good thou do'st:
teach me thy statutes, Lord.
69The men that are puff 'd up with pride
against me forg'd a lie;
Yet thy commandements observe
with my whole heart will I.
70Their hearts, through worldly ease and wealth,
as fat as grease they be:
But in thy holy law I take
delight continually.
71It hath been very good for me
that I afflicted was,
That I might well instructed be,
and learn thy holy laws.
72The word that cometh from thy mouth
is better unto me
Than many thousands and great sums
of gold and silver be.
#: The th Part.
73Thou mad'st and fashion'dst me: thy laws
to know give wisdom, Lord.
74So who thee fear shall joy to see
me trusting in thy word.
75That very right thy judgments are
I know, and do confess;
And that thou hast afflicted me
in truth and faithfulness.
76O let thy kindness merciful,
I pray thee, comfort me,
As to thy servant faithfully
was promised by thee.
77And let thy tender mercies come
to me, that I may live;
Because thy holy laws to me
sweet delectation give.
78Lord, let the proud ashamed be;
for they, without a cause,
With me perversely dealt: but I
will muse upon thy laws.
79Let such as fear thee, and have known
thy statutes, turn to me.
80My heart let in thy laws be sound,
that sham'd I never be.
#: The th Part.
81My soul for thy salvation faints;
yet I thy word believe.
82Mine eyes fail for thy word: I say,
When wilt thou comfort give?
83For like a bottle I'm become,
that in the smoke is set:
I'm black, and parch'd with grief; yet I
thy statutes not forget.
84How many are thy servant's days?
when wilt thou execute
Just judgment on these wicked men
that do me persecute?
85The proud have digged pits for me,
which is against thy laws.
86Thy words all faithful are: help me,
pursu'd without a cause.
87They so consum'd me, that on earth
my life they scarce did leave:
Thy precepts yet forsook I not,
but close to them did cleave.
88After thy loving-kindness, Lord,
me quicken, and preserve:
The testimony of thy mouth
so shall I still observe.
#: The th Part.
89Thy word for ever is, O Lord,
in heaven settled fast;
90Unto all generations
thy faithfulness doth last:
The earth thou hast established,
and it abides by thee.
91This day they stand as thou ordain'dst;
for all thy servants be.
92Unless in thy most perfect law
my soul delights had found,
I should have perished, when as
my troubles did abound.
93Thy precepts I will ne'er forget;
they quick'ning to me brought.
94Lord, I am thine; O save thou me:
thy precepts I have sought.
95For me the wicked have laid wait,
me seeking to destroy:
But I thy testimonies true
consider will with joy.
96An end of all perfection
here have I seen, O God:
But as for thy commandement,
it is exceeding broad.
#: The th Part.
97O how love I thy law! it is
my study all the day:
98It makes me wiser than my foes;
for it doth with me stay.
99Than all my teachers now I have
more understanding far;
Because my meditation
thy testimonies are.
100In understanding I excel
those that are ancients;
For I endeavoured to keep
all thy commandements.
101My feet from each ill way I stay'd,
that I may keep thy word.
102I from thy judgments have not swerv'd;
for thou hast taught me, Lord.
103How sweet unto my taste, O Lord,
are all thy words of truth!
Yea, I do find them sweeter far
than honey to my mouth.
104I through thy precepts, that are pure,
do understanding get;
I therefore ev'ry way that's false
with all my heart do hate.
#: The th Part.
105Thy word is to my feet a lamp,
and to my path a light.
106I sworn have, and I will perform,
to keep thy judgments right.
107I am with sore affliction
ev'n overwhelm'd, O Lord:
In mercy raise and quicken me,
according to thy word.
108The free-will-off 'rings of my mouth
accept, I thee beseech:
And unto me thy servant, Lord,
thy judgments clearly teach.
109Though still my soul be in my hand,
thy laws I'll not forget.
110I err'd not from them, though for me
the wicked snares did set.
111I of thy testimonies have
above all things made choice,
To be my heritage for aye;
for they my heart rejoice.
112I carefully inclined have
my heart still to attend;
That I thy statutes may perform
alway unto the end.
#: The th Part.
113I hate the thoughts of vanity,
but love thy law do I.
114My shield and hiding-place thou art:
I on thy word rely.
115All ye that evil-doers are
from me depart away;
For the commandments of my God
I purpose to obey.
116According to thy faithful word
uphold and stablish me,
That I may live, and of my hope
ashamed never be.
117Hold thou me up, so shall I be
in peace and safety still;
And to thy statutes have respect
continually I will.
118Thou tread'st down all that love to stray;
false their deceit doth prove.
119Lewd men, like dross, away thou putt'st;
therefore thy law I love.
120For fear of thee my very flesh
doth tremble, all dismay'd;
And of thy righteous judgments, Lord,
my soul is much afraid.
#: The th Part.
121To all men I have judgment done,
performing justice right;
Then let me not be left unto
my fierce oppressors' might.
122For good unto thy servant, Lord,
thy servant's surety be:
From the oppression of the proud
do thou deliver me.
123Mine eyes do fail with looking long
for thy salvation,
The word of thy pure righteousness
while I do wait upon.
124In mercy with thy servant deal,
thy laws me teach and show.
125I am thy servant, wisdom give,
that I thy laws may know.
126'Tis time thou work, Lord; for they have
made void thy law divine.
127Therefore thy precepts more I love
than gold, yea, gold most fine.
128Concerning all things thy commands
all right I judge therefore;
And ev'ry false and wicked way
I perfectly abhor.
#: The th Part.
129Thy statutes, Lord, are wonderful,
my soul them keeps with care.
130The entrance of thy words gives light,
makes wise who simple are.
131My mouth I have wide opened,
and panted earnestly,
While after thy commandements
I long'd exceedingly.
132Look on me, Lord, and merciful
do thou unto me prove,
As thou art wont to do
to those thy name who truly love.
133O let my footsteps in thy word
aright still order'd be:
Let no iniquity obtain
dominion over me.
134From man's oppression save thou me;
so keep thy laws I will.
135Thy face make on thy servant shine;
teach me thy statutes still.
136Rivers of waters from mine eyes
did run down, when I saw
How wicked men run on in sin,
and do not keep thy law.
137O Lord, thou art most righteous;
thy judgments are upright.
138Thy testimonies thou command'st
most faithful are and right.
#: The th Part.
139My zeal hath ev'n consumed me,
because mine enemies
Thy holy words forgotten have,
and do thy laws despise.
140Thy word's most pure, therefore on it
thy servant's love is set.
141Small, and despis'd I am, yet I
thy precepts not forget.
142Thy righteousness is righteousness
which ever doth endure:
Thy holy law, Lord, also is
the very truth most pure.
143Trouble and anguish have me found,
and taken hold on me:
Yet in my trouble my delight
thy just commandments be.
144Eternal righteousness is in
thy testimonies all:
Lord, to me understanding give,
and ever live I shall.
145With my whole heart I cry'd, Lord, hear;
I will thy word obey.
146I cry'd to thee; save me, and I
will keep thy laws alway.
147I of the morning did prevent
the dawning, and did cry:
For all mine expectation
did on thy word rely.
148Mine eyes did timeously prevent
the watches of the night,
That in thy word with careful mind
then meditate I might.
149After thy loving-kindness hear
my voice, that calls on thee:
According to thy judgment, Lord,
revive and quicken me.
150Who follow mischief they draw nigh;
they from thy law are far:
151But thou art near, Lord; most firm truth
all thy commandments are.
152As for thy testimonies all,
of old this have I try'd,
That thou hast surely founded them
for ever to abide.
153Consider mine affliction,
in safety do me set:
Deliver me, O Lord, for I
thy law do not forget.
154After thy word revive thou me: save me,
and plead my cause.
155Salvation is from sinners far;
for they seek not thy laws.
156O Lord, both great and manifold
thy tender mercies be:
According to thy judgments just,
revive and quicken me.
157My persecutors many are,
and foes that do combine;
Yet from thy testimonies pure
my heart doth not decline.
158I saw transgressors, and was griev'd;
for they keep not thy word.
159See how I love thy law! as thou
art kind, me quicken, Lord.
160From the beginning all thy word
hath been most true and sure:
Thy righteous judgments ev'ry one
for evermore endure.
161Princes have persecuted me,
although no cause they saw:
But still of thy most holy word
my heart doth stand in awe.
162I at thy word rejoice, as one
of spoil that finds great store.
163Thy law I love; but lying all
I hate and do abhor.
164Sev'n times a-day it is my care
to give due praise to thee;
Because of all thy judgments, Lord,
which righteous ever be.
165Great peace have they who love thy law;
offence they shall have none.
166I hop'd for thy salvation, Lord,
and thy commands have done.
167My soul thy testimonies pure
observed carefully;
On them my heart is set, and them
I love exceedingly.
168Thy testimonies and thy laws
I kept with special care;
For all my works and ways each one
before thee open are.
169O let my earnest pray'r and cry
come near before thee, Lord:
Give understanding unto me,
according to thy word.
170Let my request before thee come:
after thy word me free.
171My lips shall utter praise, when thou
hast taught thy laws to me.
172My tongue of thy most blessed word
shall speak, and it confess;
Because all thy commandements
are perfect righteousness.
173Let thy strong hand make help to me:
thy precepts are my choice.
174I long'd for thy salvation, Lord,
and in thy law rejoice.
175O let my soul live, and it shall
give praises unto thee;
And let thy judgments gracious
be helpful unto me.
176I, like a lost sheep, went astray;
thy servant seek, and find:
For thy commands I suffer'd not
to slip out of my mind.

A Song of Ascents
1In my distress to God I cry'd,
and he gave ear to me.
2From lying lips, and guileful tongue,
O Lord, my soul set free.
3What shall be giv'n thee? or what
shall be done to thee, false tongue?
4Ev'n burning coals of juniper,
sharp arrows of the strong.
5Woe's me that I in Mesech am
a sojourner so long;
That I in tabernacles dwell
to Kedar that belong.
6My soul with him that hateth peace
hath long a dweller been.
7I am for peace; but when I speak,
for battle they are keen.

A Psalm of Ascents
1I to the hills will lift mine eyes,
from whence doth come mine aid.
2My safety cometh from the Lord,
who heav'n and earth hath made.
3Thy foot he'll not let slide, nor will
he slumber that thee keeps.
4Behold, he that keeps Israel,
he slumbers not, nor sleeps.
5The Lord thee keeps, the Lord thy shade
on thy right hand doth stay:
6The moon by night thee shall not smite,
nor yet the sun by day.
7The Lord shall keep thy soul; he shall
preserve thee from all ill.
8Henceforth thy going out and in
God keep for ever will.

PSALM 122
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
A Song of Ascents,
Of David.
1I joy'd when to the house of God,
Go up, they said to me.
2Jerusalem, within thy gates
our feet shall standing be.
3Jerus'lem, as a city, is
compactly built together:
4Unto that place the tribes go up,
the tribes of God go thither:
To Isr'el's testimony, there
to God's name thanks to pay.
5For thrones of judgment, ev'n the thrones
of David's house, there stay.
6Pray that Jerusalem may have
peace and felicity:
Let them that love thee and thy peace
have still prosperity.
7Therefore I wish that peace may still
within thy walls remain,
And ever may thy palaces
prosperity retain.
8Now, for my friends' and brethren's sakes,
Peace be in thee, I'll say.
9And for the house of God our Lord,
I'll seek thy good alway.

PSALM 123
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
A Song of Ascents
1O thou that dwellest in the heav'ns,
I lift mine eyes to thee.
2Behold, as servants' eyes do look
their masters' hand to see,
As handmaid's eyes her mistress' hand;
so do our eyes attend
Upon the Lord our God, until
to us he mercy send.
3O Lord, be gracious to us,
unto us gracious be;
Because replenish'd with contempt
exceedingly are we.
4Our soul is fill'd with scorn of those
that at their ease abide,
And with the insolent contempt
of those that swell in pride.

First Version

1Had not the Lord been on our side,
may Israel now say;
2Had not the Lord been on our side,
when men rose us to slay;
3They had us swallow'd quick, when as
their wrath 'gainst us did flame:
4Waters had cover'd us, our soul
had sunk beneath the stream.
5Then had the waters, swelling high,
over our soul made way.
6Bless'd be the Lord, who to their teeth
us gave not for a prey.
7Our soul's escaped, as a bird
out of the fowler's snare;
The snare asunder broken is,
and we escaped are.
8Our sure and all-sufficient help
is in JEHOVAH's name;
His name who did the heav'n create,
and who the earth did frame.

PSALM 124b

Bug: this is a 5 line per stanza Psalm
1Now Israel
may say, and that truly,
If that the Lord
had not our cause maintain'd;
2If that the Lord
had not our right sustain'd,
When cruel men
against us furiously
Rose up in wrath,
to make of us their prey;
3Then certainly
they had devour'd us all,
And swallow'd quick,
for ought that we could deem;
Such was their rage,
as we might well esteem.
4And as fierce floods
before them all things drown,
So had they brought
our soul to death quite down.
5The raging streams,
with their proud swelling waves,
Had then our soul
o'erwhelmed in the deep.
6But bless'd be God,
who doth us safely keep,
And hath not giv'n
us for a living prey
Unto their teeth,
and bloody cruelty.
7Ev'n as a bird
out of the fowler's snare
Escapes away,
so is our soul set free;
Broke are their nets,
and thus escaped we.
8Therefore our help
is in the Lord's great name,
Who heav'n and earth
by his great pow'r did frame.

PSALM 125
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1They in the Lord that firmly trust
shall be like Sion hill,
Which at no time can be remov'd,
but standeth ever still.
2As round about Jerusalem
the mountains stand alway,
The Lord his folk doth compass so,
from henceforth and for aye.
3For ill men's rod upon the lot
of just men shall not lie;
Lest righteous men stretch
forth their hands unto iniquity.
4Do thou to all those that be good
thy goodness, Lord, impart;
And do thou good to those that are
upright within their heart.
5But as for such as turn aside
after their crooked way,
God shall lead forth with wicked men:
on Isr'el peace shall stay.

PSALM 126
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1When Sion's bondage God turn'd back,
as men that dream'd were we.
2Then fill'd with laughter was our mouth,
our tongue with melody:
They 'mong the heathen said, The Lord
great things for them hath wrought.
3The Lord hath done great things for us,
whence joy to us is brought.
4As streams of water in the south,
our bondage, Lord, recall.
5Who sow in tears, a reaping time
of joy enjoy they shall.
6That man who, bearing precious seed,
in going forth doth mourn,
He doubtless, bringing back his sheaves,
rejoicing shall return.

PSALM 127
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Except the Lord do build the house,
the builders lose their pain:
Except the Lord the city keep,
the watchmen watch in vain.
2'Tis vain for you to rise betimes,
or late from rest to keep,
To feed on sorrows' bread;
so gives he his beloved sleep.
3Lo, children are God's heritage,
the womb's fruit his reward.
4The sons of youth as arrows are,
for strong men's hands prepar'd.
5O happy is the man that hath
his quiver fill'd with those;
They unashamed in the gate
shall speak unto their foes.

PSALM 128
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Bless'd is each one that fears the Lord,
and walketh in his ways;
2For of thy labour thou shalt eat,
and happy be always.
3Thy wife shall as a fruitful vine
by thy house' sides be found:
Thy children like to olive-plants
about thy table round.
4Behold, the man that fears the Lord,
thus blessed shall he be.
5The Lord shall out of Sion give
his blessing unto thee:
Thou shalt Jerus'lem's good behold
whilst thou on earth dost dwell.
6Thou shalt thy children's children see,
and peace on Israel.

PSALM 129
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Oft did they vex me from my youth,

2Oft did they vex me from my youth,
yet not victorious were.
3The plowers plow'd upon my back;
they long their furrows drew.
4The righteous Lord did cut the cords
of the ungodly crew.
5Let Sion's haters all be turn'd
back with confusion.
6As grass on houses' tops be they,
which fades ere it be grown:
7Whereof enough to fill his hand
the mower cannot find;
Nor can the man his bosom fill,
whose work is sheaves to bind.
8Neither say they who do go by,
God's blessing on you rest:
We in the name of God
the Lord do wish you to be blest.

PSALM 130
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Lord, from the depths to thee I cry'd.
2My voice, Lord, do thou hear:
Unto my supplication's voice
give an attentive ear.
3Lord, who shall stand, if thou, O Lord,
should'st mark iniquity?
4But yet with thee forgiveness is,
that fear'd thou mayest be.
5I wait for God, my soul doth wait,
my hope is in his word.
6More than they that for morning watch,
my soul waits for the Lord;
I say, more than they that do watch
the morning light to see.
7Let Israel hope in the Lord,
for with him mercies be;
And plenteous redemption
is ever found with him.
8And from all his iniquities
he Isr'el shall redeem.

PSALM 131

A Song of degrees of David.
1My heart not haughty is, O Lord,

Nor do I deal in matters great,
or things too high for me.
2I surely have myself behav'd

As child of mother wean'd: my soul

3Upon the Lord let all the hope
of Israel rely,
Ev'n from the time that present is

1David, and his afflictions all,
Lord, do thou think upon;
2How unto God he sware,
and vow'd to Jacob's mighty One.
3I will not come within my house,
nor rest in bed at all;
4Nor shall mine eyes take any sleep,
nor eyelids slumber shall;
5Till for the Lord a place I find,
where he may make abode;
A place of habitation
for Jacob's mighty God.
6Lo, at the place of Ephratah
of it we understood;
And we did find it in the fields,
and city of the wood.
7We'll go into his tabernacles,
and at his footstool bow.
8Arise, O Lord, into thy rest,
th' ark of thy strength, and thou.
9O let thy priests be clothed, Lord,
with truth and righteousness;
And let all those that are thy saints
shout loud for joyfulness.
10For thine own servant David's sake,
do not deny thy grace;
Nor of thine own anointed one
turn thou away the face.
11The Lord in truth to David sware,
he will not turn from it,
I of thy body's fruit will make
upon thy throne to sit.
12My cov'nant if thy sons will keep,
and laws to them made known,
Their children then shall also sit
for ever on thy throne.
13For God of Sion hath made choice;
there he desires to dwell.
14This is my rest, here still I'll stay;
for I do like it well.
15Her food I'll greatly bless; her poor
with bread will satisfy.
16Her priests I'll clothe with health; her saints
shall shout forth joyfully.
17And there will I make David's horn
to bud forth pleasantly:
For him that mine anointed is
a lamp ordain'd have I.
18As with a garment I will clothe
with shame his en'mies all:
But yet the crown that he doth wear
upon him flourish shall.

PSALM 133
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Behold, how good a thing it is,
and how becoming well,
Together such as brethren are
in unity to dwell!
2Like precious ointment on the head,
that down the beard did flow,
Ev'n Aaron's beard, and to the skirts,
did of his garments go.
3As Hermon's dew, the dew that doth
on Sion' hills descend:
For there the blessing God commands,
life that shall never end.

PSALM 134

3From Sion' hill the Lord thee bless,

PSALM 135
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Praise ye the Lord, the Lord's name praise;
his servants, praise ye God.
2Who stand in God's house, in the courts
of our God make abode.
3Praise ye the Lord, for he is good;
unto him praises sing:
Sing praises to his name, because
it is a pleasant thing.
4For Jacob to himself the Lord
did chuse of his good pleasure,
And he hath chosen Israel
for his peculiar treasure.
5Because I know assuredly
the Lord is very great,
And that our Lord above all gods
in glory hath his seat.
6What things soever pleas'd the Lord,
that in the heav'n did he,
And in the earth, the seas,
and all the places deep that be.
7He from the ends of earth doth make
the vapours to ascend;
With rain he lightnings makes, and wind
doth from his treasures send.
8Egypt's first-born, from man to beast
9who smote. Strange tokens he
On Phar'oh and his servants sent,
Egypt, in midst of thee.
10He smote great nations, slew great kings:
11Sihon of Heshbon king,
And Og of Bashan, and to nought
did Canaan's kingdoms bring:
12And for a wealthy heritage
their pleasant land he gave,
An heritage which Israel,
his chosen folk, should have.
13Thy name, O Lord, shall still endure,
and thy memorial
With honour shall continu'd be
to generations all.
14For why? the righteous God will judge
his people righteously;
Concerning those that do him serve,
himself repent will he.
15The idols of the nations
of silver are and gold,
And by the hands of men is made
their fashion and mould.
16Mouths have they, but they do not speak;
eyes, but they do not see;
17Ears have they, but hear not; and in
their mouths no breathing be.
18Their makers are like them; so are
all that on them rely.
19O Isr'el's house, bless God; bless God,
O Aaron's family.
20O bless the Lord, of Levi's house
ye who his servants are;
And bless the holy name of God,
all ye the Lord that fear.
21And blessed be the Lord our God
from Sion's holy hill,
Who dwelleth at Jerusalem.
The Lord O praise ye still.

1By Babel's streams we sat and wept,
when Sion we thought on.
2In midst thereof we hang'd our harps
the willow-trees upon.
3For there a song required they,
who did us captive bring:
Our spoilers call'd for mirth, and said,
A song of Sion sing.
4O how the Lord's song shall we sing
within a foreign land?
5If thee, Jerus'lem, I forget,
skill part from my right hand.
6My tongue to my mouth's roof let cleave,
if I do thee forget,
Jerusalem, and thee above
my chief joy do not set.
7Remember Edom's children, Lord,
who in Jerus'lems day,
Ev'n unto its foundation,
Raze, raze it quite, did say.
8O daughter thou of Babylon,
near to destruction;
Bless'd shall he be that thee rewards,
as thou to us hast done.
9Yea, happy surely shall he be
thy tender little ones
Who shall lay hold upon,
and them shall dash against the stones.

1Thee will I praise with all my heart,

2Before the gods: And worship will

I'll praise thy name, ev'n for thy truth,
and kindness of thy love;
For thou thy word hast magnify'd
all thy great name above.
3Thou didst me answer in the day
when I to thee did cry;
And thou my fainting soul with strength
didst strengthen inwardly.
4All kings upon the earth that are
shall give thee praise, O Lord,
When as they from thy mouth shall hear
thy true and faithful word.
5Yea, in the righteous ways of God
with gladness they shall sing:
For great's the glory of the Lord;
who doth for ever reign.
6Though God be high, yet he respects
all those that lowly be;
Whereas the proud and lofty ones
afar off knoweth he.
7Though I in midst of trouble walk,
I life from thee shall have:
'Gainst my foes' wrath thou'lt stretch thine hand;
thy right hand shall me save.
8Surely that which concerneth me
the Lord will perfect make:
Lord, still thy mercy lasts; do not

PSALM 139
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
To the chief Musician,
A Psalm of David.
1O Lord, thou hast me search'd and known.
2Thou know'st my sitting down,
And rising up; yea, all my thoughts
afar to thee are known.
3My footsteps, and my lying down,
thou compassest always;
Thou also most entirely art
acquaint with all my ways.
4For in my tongue, before I speak,
not any word can be,
But altogether, lo, O Lord,
it is well known to thee.
5Behind, before, thou hast beset,
and laid on me thine hand.
6Such knowledge is too strange for me,
too high to understand.
7From thy Sp'rit whither shall I go?
or from thy presence fly?
8Ascend I heav'n, lo, thou art there;
there, if in hell I lie.
9Take I the morning wings, and dwell
in utmost parts of sea;
10Ev'n there, Lord, shall thy hand me lead,
thy right hand hold shall me.
11If I do say that darkness shall
me cover from thy sight,
Then surely shall the very night
about me be as light.
12Yea, darkness hideth not from thee,
but night doth shine as day:
To thee the darkness and the light
are both alike alway.
13For thou possessed hast my reins,
and thou hast cover'd me,
When I within my mother's womb
inclosed was by thee.
14Thee will I praise; for fearfully
and strangely made I am;
Thy works are marv'llous, and right well
my soul doth know the same.
15My substance was not hid from thee,
when as in secret I
Was made; and in earth's lowest parts
was wrought most curiously.
16Thine eyes my substance did behold,
yet being unperfect;
And in the volume of thy book
my members all were writ;
Which after in continuance
were fashion'd ev'ry one,
When as they yet all shapeless were,
and of them there was none.
17How precious also are thy thoughts,
O gracious God, to me!
And in their sum how passing great
and numberless they be!
18If I should count them, than the sand
they more in number be:
What time soever I awake,
I ever am with thee.
19Thou, Lord, wilt sure the wicked slay:
hence from me bloody men.
20Thy foes against thee loudly speak,
and take thy name in vain.
21Do not I hate all those, O Lord,
that hatred bear to thee?
With those that up against thee rise
can I but grieved be?
22With perfect hatred them I hate,
my foes I them do hold.
23Search me, O God, and know my heart,
try me, my thoughts unfold:
24And see if any wicked way
there be at all in me;
And in thine everlasting way
to me a leader be.

1Lord, from the ill and froward man
give me deliverance,
And do thou safe preserve me from
the man of violence:
2Who in their heart mischievous things
are meditating ever;
And they for war assembled are
continually together.
3Much like unto a serpent's tongue
their tongues they sharp do make;
And underneath their lips there lies
the poison of a snake.
4Lord, keep me from the wicked's hands,
from vi'lent men me save;
Who utterly to overthrow
my goings purpos'd have.
5The proud for me a snare have hid,
and cords; yea, they a net
Have by the way-side for me spread;
they gins for me have set.
6I said unto the Lord, Thou art
my God: unto the cry
Of all my supplications,
Lord, do thine ear apply.
7O God the Lord, who art the strength
of my salvation:
A cov'ring in the day of war
my head thou hast put on.
8Unto the wicked man, O Lord,
his wishes do not grant;
Nor further thou his ill device,
lest they themselves should vaunt.
9As for the head and chief of those
about that compass me,
Ev'n by the mischief of their lips
let thou them cover'd be.
10Let burning coals upon them fall,
them throw in fiery flame,
And in deep pits, that they no more
may rise out of the same.
11Let not an evil speaker be
on earth established:
Mischief shall hunt the vi'lent man,
till he be ruined.
12I know God will th' afflicted's cause
maintain, and poor men's right.
13Surely the just shall praise thy name;
th' upright dwell in thy sight.

PSALM 141
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6

1O Lord, I unto thee do cry,

And give an ear unto my voice,

2As incense let my prayer be
directed in thine eyes;
And the uplifting of my hands
as th' ev 'ning sacrifice.
3Set, Lord, a watch before my mouth,
keep of my lips the door.
4My heart incline thou not unto
the ills I should abhor,
To practise wicked works with men
that work iniquity;
And with their delicates my taste
let me not satisfy.
5Let him that righteous is me smite,
it shall a kindness be;
Let him reprove, I shall it count
a precious oil to me:
Such smiting shall not break my head;
for yet the time shall fall,
When I in their calamities
to God pray for them shall.
6When as their judges down shall be
in stony places cast,
Then shall they hear my words; for they
shall sweet be to their taste.
7About the grave's devouring mouth
our bones are scatter'd round,
As wood which men do cut and cleave
lies scatter'd on the ground.
8But unto thee, O God the Lord,
mine eyes uplifted be:
My soul do not leave destitute;
my trust is set on thee.
9Lord, keep me safely from the snares
which they for me prepare;
And from the subtile gins of them
that wicked workers are.
10Let workers of iniquity
into their own nets fall,
Whilst I do, by thine help, escape
the danger of them all.

my trouble I exprest.
3When in me was o'erwhelm'd my sp'rit,
then well thou knew'st my way;
Where I did walk a snare for me
they privily did lay.
4I look'd on my right hand, and view'd,
but none to know me were;
All refuge failed me, no man
did for my soul take care.
5I cry'd to thee; I said, Thou art
my refuge, Lord, alone;
And in the land of those that live
thou art my portion.
6Because I am brought very low,
attend unto my cry:
Me from my persecutors save,
who stronger are than I.
7From prison bring my soul, that I
thy name may glorify:

Give thou an answer unto me,

2Thy servant also bring thou not
in judgment to be try'd:
Because no living man can be
in thy sight justify'd.
3For th' en'my hath pursu'd my soul,
my life to ground down tread:
In darkness he hath made me dwell,

4My sp'rit is therefore overwhelm'd

Within me is my very heart
amazed wondrously.
5I call to mind the days of old,
to meditate I use
On all thy works; upon the deeds
I of thy hands do muse.
6My hands to thee I stretch; my soul
thirsts, as dry land, for thee.
7Haste, Lord, to hear, my spirit fails:
hide not thy face from me;
Lest like to them I do become
that go down to the dust.
8At morn let me thy kindness hear;
for in thee do I trust.
Teach me the way that I should walk:
I lift my soul to thee.
9Lord, free me from my foes; I flee
to thee to cover me.
10Because thou art my God, to do
thy will do me instruct:
Thy Sp'rit is good, me to the land
of uprightness conduct.
11Revive and quicken me, O Lord,
ev'n for thine own name's sake;
And do thou, for thy righteousness,
my soul from trouble take.

let all destroyed be
That do afflict my soul: for I
a servant am to thee.

To bow thine ear accord,

And, in thy faithfulness,
Unto me answer make,
And, in thy righteousness,
Upon me pity take.
2In judgment enter not
With me thy servant poor;
For why, this well I wot,
No sinner can endure
The sight of thee, O God:
If thou his deeds shalt try,
He dare make none abode
Himself to justify.
3Behold, the cruel foe
Me persecutes with spite,

Yea, he my life down quite
Unto the ground hath smote,
And made me dwell full low
In darkness, as forgot,
Or men dead long ago.

O'erwhelm'd is me within;
My heart right sore perplex'd
And desolate hath been.
5Yet I do call to mind
What ancient days record,
Thy works of ev'ry kind
I think upon, O Lord.
6Lo, I do stretch my hands
To thee, my help alone;
For thou well understands
All my complaint and moan:
My thirsting soul desires,
And longeth after thee,
As thirsty ground requires
With rain refresh'd to be.
7Lord, let my pray'r prevail,
To answer it make speed;
For, lo, my sp'rit doth fail:
Hide not thy face in need;
Lest I be like to those
That do in darkness sit,
Or him that downward goes
Into the dreadful pit.
8Because I trust in thee,
O Lord, cause me to hear
Thy loving-kindness free,
When morning doth appear:
Cause me to know the way
Wherein my path should be;
For why, my soul on high
I do lift up to thee.
9From my fierce enemy
In safety do me guide,
Because I flee to thee,
Lord, that thou may'st me hide.
10My God alone art thou,
Teach me thy righteousness:
Thy Sp'rit's good, lead me to
The land of uprightness.
11O Lord, for thy name's sake,
Be pleas'd to quicken me;
And, for thy truth, forth take
My soul from misery.
12And of thy grace destroy
My foes, and put to shame
All who my soul annoy;
For I thy servant am.

PSALM 144
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
A Psalm of David.
1O blessed ever be the Lord,
who is my strength and might,
Who doth instruct my hands to war,
my fingers teach to fight.
2My goodness, fortress, my high tow'r,
deliverer, and shield,
In whom I trust: who under me
my people makes to yield.
3Lord, what is man, that thou of him
dost so much knowledge take?
Or son of man, that thou of him
so great account dost make?
4Man is like vanity; his days,
as shadows, pass away.
5Lord, bow thy heav'ns, come down, touch thou
the hills, and smoke shall they.
6Cast forth thy lightning, scatter them;
thine arrows shoot, them rout.
7Thine hand send from above, me save;
from great depths draw me out;
And from the hand of children strange,
8Whose mouth speaks vanity;
And their right hand is a right hand
that works deceitfully.
9A new song I to thee will sing,
Lord, on a psaltery;
I on a ten-string'd instrument
will praises sing to thee.
10Ev'n he it is that unto kings
salvation doth send;
Who his own servant David doth
from hurtful sword defend.
11O free me from strange children's hand,
whose mouth speaks vanity;
And their right hand a right hand is
that works deceitfully.
12That, as the plants, our sons may be
in youth grown up that are;
Our daughters like to corner-stones,
carv'd like a palace fair.
13That to afford all kind of store
our garners may be fill'd;
That our sheep thousands, in our streets
ten thousands they may yield.
14That strong our oxen be for work,
that no in-breaking be,
Nor going out; and that our streets
may from complaints be free.
15Those people blessed are who be
in such a case as this;
Yea, blessed all those people are,
whose God JEHOVAH is.

PSALM 145
First Version
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1I'll thee extol, my God, O King;
I'll bless thy name always.
2Thee will I bless each day, and will
thy name for ever praise.
3Great is the Lord, much to be prais'd;
his greatness search exceeds.
4Race unto race shall praise thy works,
and shew thy mighty deeds.
5I of thy glorious majesty
the honour will record;
I'll speak of all thy mighty works,
which wondrous are, O Lord.
6Men of thine acts the might shall show,
thine acts that dreadful are;
And I, thy glory to advance,
thy greatness will declare.
7The mem'ry of thy goodness great
they largely shall express;
With songs of praise they shall extol
thy perfect righteousness.
8The Lord is very gracious,
in him compassions flow;
In mercy he is very great,
and is to anger slow.
9The Lord JEHOVAH unto all
his goodness doth declare;
And over all his other works
his tender mercies are.
10Thee all thy works shall praise, O Lord,
and thee thy saints shall bless;
11They shall thy kingdom's glory show,
thy pow'r by speech express:
12To make the sons of men to know
his acts done mightily,
And of his kingdom th' excellent
and glorious majesty.
13Thy kingdom shall for ever stand,
thy reign through ages all.
14God raiseth all that are bow'd down,
upholdeth all that fall.
15The eyes of all things wait on thee,
the giver of all good;
And thou, in time convenient,
bestow'st on them their food:
16Thine hand thou open'st lib'rally,
and of thy bounty gives
Enough to satisfy the need
of ev'ry thing that lives.
17The Lord is just in all his ways,
holy in his works all.
18God's near to all that call on him,
in truth that on him call.
19He will accomplish the desire
of those that do him fear:
He also will deliver them,
and he their cry will hear.
20The Lord preserves all who him love,
that nought can them annoy:
But he all those that wicked are
will utterly destroy.
21My mouth the praises of the Lord
to publish cease shall never:
Let all flesh bless his holy name
for ever and for ever.

PSALM 146
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Praise God. The Lord praise, O my soul.
2I'll praise God while I live;
While I have being to my God
in songs I'll praises give.
3Trust not in princes, nor man's son,
in whom there is no stay:
4His breath departs, to's earth he turns;
that day his thoughts decay.
5O happy is that man and blest,
whom Jacob's God doth aid;
Whose hope upon the Lord doth rest,
and on his God is stay'd:
6Who made the earth and heavens high,
who made the swelling deep,
And all that is within the same;
who truth doth ever keep:
7Who righteous judgment executes
for those oppress'd that be,
Who to the hungry giveth food;
God sets the pris'ners free.
8The Lord doth give the blind their sight,
the bowed down doth raise:
The Lord doth dearly love all those
that walk in upright ways.
9The stranger's shield, the widow's stay,
the orphan's help, is he:
But yet by him the wicked's way
turn'd upside down shall be.
10The Lord shall reign for evermore:
thy God, O Sion, he
Reigns to all generations.
Praise to the Lord give ye.

PSALM 147
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Praise ye the Lord; for it is good
praise to our God to sing:
For it is pleasant, and to praise
it is a comely thing.
2God doth build up Jerusalem;
and he it is alone
That the dispers'd of Israel
doth gather into one.
3Those that are broken in their heart,
and grieved in their minds,
He healeth, and their painful wounds
he tenderly up-binds.
4He counts the number of the stars;
he names them ev'ry one.
5Great is our Lord, and of great pow'r;
his wisdom search can none.
6The Lord lifts up the meek; and casts
the wicked to the ground.
7Sing to the Lord, and give him thanks;
on harp his praises sound;
8Who covereth the heav'n with clouds,
who for the earth below
Prepareth rain, who maketh grass
upon the mountains grow.
9He gives the beast his food, he feeds
the ravens young that cry.
10His pleasure not in horses' strength,
nor in man's legs, doth lie.
11But in all those that do him fear
the Lord doth pleasure take;
In those that to his mercy do
by hope themselves betake.
12The Lord praise, O Jerusalem;
Sion, thy God confess:
13For thy gates' bars he maketh strong;
thy sons in thee doth bless.
14He in thy borders maketh peace;
with fine wheat filleth thee.
15He sends forth his command on earth,
his word runs speedily.
16Hoar-frost, like ashes, scatt'reth he;
like wool he snow doth give:
17Like morsels casteth forth his ice;
who in its cold can live?
18He sendeth forth his mighty word,
and melteth them again;
His wind he makes to blow,
and then the waters flow amain.
19The doctrine of his holy word
to Jacob he doth show;
His statutes and his judgments he
gives Israel to know.
20To any nation never he
such favour did afford;
For they his judgments have not known.
O do ye praise the Lord.

PSALM 148
First Version
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Praise God. From heavens praise the Lord,
in heights praise to him be.
2All ye his angels, praise ye him;
his hosts all, praise him ye.
3O praise ye him, both sun and moon,
praise him, all stars of light.
4Ye heav'ns of heav'ns him praise, and floods
above the heavens' height.
5Let all the creatures praise the name
of our almighty Lord:
For he commanded, and they were
created by his word.
6He also, for all times to come,
hath them establish'd sure;
He hath appointed them a law,
which ever shall endure.
7Praise ye JEHOVAH from the earth,
dragons, and ev'ry deep:
8Fire, hail, snow, vapour, stormy wind,
his word that fully keep.
9All hills and mountains, fruitful trees,
and all ye cedars high:
10Beasts, and all cattle, creeping things,
and all ye birds that fly.
11Kings of the earth, all nations,
princes, earth's judges all:
12Both young men, yea, and maidens too,
old men, and children small.
13Let them God's name praise; for his name
alone is excellent:
His glory reacheth far above
the earth and firmament.
14His people's horn, the praise of all
his saints, exalteth he;
Ev'n Isr'el's seed, a people near
to him. The Lord praise ye.

PSALM 148b
Second Version
Meter: 6,6,6,6,8,8
1The Lord of heav'n confess,
On high his glory raise
2Him let all angels bless,
Him all his armies praise
3Him glorify
Sun, moon, and stars;
4Ye higher spheres,
And cloudy sky.
5From God your beings are,
Him therefore famous make;
You all created were,
When he the word but spake.
6And from that place,
Where fix'd you be
By his decree,
You cannot pass.
7Praise God from earth below,
Ye dragons, and ye deeps:
8Fire, hail, clouds, wind, and snow.
Whom in command he keeps.
9Praise ye his name,
Hills great and small,
Trees low and tall;
10Beasts wild and tame;
All things that creep or fly.
11Ye kings, ye vulgar throng,
All princes mean or high;
12Both men and virgins young,
Ev'n young and old,
13Exalt his name;
For much his fame
Should be extoll'd.
O let God's name be prais'd
Above both earth and sky;
14For he his saints hath rais'd,
And set their horn on high;
Ev'n those that be
Of Isr'el's race,
Near to his grace.
The Lord praise ye.

PSALM 149
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Praise ye the Lord: unto him sing
a new song, and his praise
In the assembly of his saints
in sweet psalms do ye raise.
2Let Isr'el in his Maker joy,
and to him praises sing:
Let all that Sion's children are
be joyful in their King.
3O let them unto his great name
give praises in the dance;
Let them with timbrel and with harp
in songs his praise advance.
4For God doth pleasure take in those
that his own people be;
And he with his salvation
the meek will beautify.
5And in his glory excellent
let all his saints rejoice:
Let them to him upon their beds
aloud lift up their voice.
6Let in their mouth aloft be rais'd
the high praise of the Lord,
And let them have in their right hand
a sharp two-edged sword;
7To execute the vengeance due
upon the heathen all,
And make deserved punishment
upon the people fall.
8And ev'n with chains, as pris'ners, bind
their kings that them command;
Yea, and with iron fetters strong,
the nobles of their land.
9On them the judgment to perform
found written in his word:
This honour is to all his saints.
O do ye praise the Lord.

PSALM 150
Common Meter: 8,6,8,6
1Praise ye the Lord. God's praise within
his sanctuary raise;
And to him in the firmament
of his pow'r give ye praise.
2Because of all his mighty acts,
with praise him magnify:
O praise him, as he doth excel
in glorious majesty.
3Praise him with trumpet's sound; his praise
with psaltery advance:
4With timbrel, harp, string'd instruments,
and organs, in the dance.
5Praise him on cymbals loud; him praise
on cymbals sounding high.
6Let each thing breathing praise the Lord.
Praise to the Lord give ye.

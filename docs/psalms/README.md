# Psalms

This text of the Psalms is identical to that printed by the Trinitarian Bible Society in the Psalms of David in Metre. Thanks to bible.com and the British and Foreign Bible Society for making this text publicly available.

Many of the texts available elsewhere online use slightly different spelling to what is usually published in the physical Psalters originating from the United Kingdom.

The `psalms.txt` in this directory contains the 150 Psalms and the 13 second versions.

## Roadmap

* Suggested tunes and live recordings for each psalm will be added as helps.
* There are plans to add inline commentaries, such as John Brown of Haddington.
* The additional Irish versions will eventually be made available.
